In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 on two Ser-465 and Ser-467, and SMAD3 on Ser-423 and Ser-425. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.	Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighbouring R-Smad subunits.

The DNA recognition sequence depends on the composition of the bZIP dimer with the complex either binding to the preferred region of one of the partners or to a novel bZIP cognate site.	Dimerization is mediated by the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) 60-80 amino acid domain, consisting of a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The latter domain adopts an alpha helical structure where leucine, or leucine-like, side chains line up on the same side of the helix and interact with the alpha helix of the leucine zipper of the other family member to enable dimer formation. DNA binding specificity appears to be linked to low-affinity binding sites which guide transcription factors to their cognate target sites.

Binding of the ligand AMP in response to atrial distension (high blood volume) plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and salt-fluid volume homeostasis. Binding of atrial natriuretic peptide ANP to ANPR-A dimer activates the receptor and stimulates its guanylate cyclase activity, thereby elevating intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in return mediates the hormonal actions through cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases. The end result is a reduction in blood volume and, therefore, a reduction in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure.	The ANPR-A dimer complex is composed of two ANPR-A molecules. The ANPR-A monomer has a membrane-distal and a membrane-proximal domain, each consisting of a central beta-sheet surrounded by alpha helices. The ANPR-A monomers form a head-to-head dimer through their membrane distal domains. The membrane-distal domains also bind chloride ions, necessary for ANP binding. ANP binding induces structural changes to the ANPR-A dimer. These involve a shift of the relative positions of the two ANPR-A monomers. This brings two active sites of the GCase domains to optimal proximity and orientation, thereby giving rise to the GCase catalytic activity.

Cardiac PLN is a main determinant of muscle contraction and relaxation. In the unphosphorylated form PLN inhibits the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a membrane protein responsible for the pumping most of the calcium from the cytoplasm to the SR, thereby causing a relaxation of myofibrils.	The cardiac PLN homopentamer is a 30-kDa complex composed of 5 PLN monomers. Each of the monomers consists of a short, positively charged amphipathic (AP) alpha-helix, an extended linker and a long TM alpha-helix. PLN pentamer forms an unusual bell flower-like assembly held together by leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs along the membrane-spanning helices. The structure has some unexpected features, such as a strong curvature of the TM helix and an axial orientation of the AP helix.

It binds DNA either as a monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer complex to activate or inhibit expression of genes.	The NKX-2.5 homodimer complex is composed of two NKX-2.5 molecules interacting possibly at the C-terminus of their homeobox domains (HD). Lys(193) and Arg(194) located at the HD C-terminus are essential residues for homodimerization. In the presence of DNA bound to the complex, each NKX-2.5 monomer interacts with a DNA strand through a HD. A single missense mutation, Ile(183) to Pro in the HD preserves the homodimerization, but totally abolishes DNA binding.

The extensive interactions between the two proteins indicate that Telethonin provides a 'bridge' that anchors the ends of two different Titin molecules to the Z disk. There is evidence that Telethonin binding to Titin might be essential for the initial assembly, stabilization and functional integrity of the Titin filament and hence important for muscle contraction relaxation in mature myofibrils.	The N-terminus of Titin comprising of Z1 and Z2 IgG-like domains is assembled into an antiparallel sandwich complex with the titin-binding domain of telethonin with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Telethonin has a pseudosymmetric structure which mediates a palindromic arrangement of two Titin filaments. This arrangement is unique, previously found only in palindromic or pseudopalindromic protein-DNA complexes. Structural and binding evidence suggests that telethonin might act as a Titin-Titin crosslinker, indicating the binding is very tight. It is believed that the Titin N-terminus-Telethonin complex forms a core that interacts with several ligands both inside and outside the sarcomeric Z disk, including MLP, sAnkyrin, the beta subunit of the minK potassium channel , gamma-filamin/ABP-L, alpha actinin and the telethonin binding protein of the Z disk (FATZ).

Na+/K+ pumps can also generate an inward current of protons. Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current. 	The alpha subunit contains the Na+, K+ and ATP binding sites. The beta subunit is required for routing of the alpha subunit to the plasma membrane and for occlusion of the K+ ions. The gamma subunit regulates the pumping activity in a tissue- and isoform-specific way. Occlusion of K+ is vital for the stability of the complex.

Consequently, a reduction in the internalisation of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) occurs, leading to high plasma levels of LDLs, causing familial hypercholesterolemia type 3. Formation of the complex interferes with an acid-dependent conformational change of LDLR required for receptor recycling via the endosome. Instead, PCSK9 binding to LDLR can induce its ubiquitination leading to rerouteing of LDLR to the lysosome where it is degraded.	After auto-cleavage of PCSK9 at 152Gln, its pro-domain (Pro) remains tightly associated with its subtilisin-like catalytic domain (Cat) and both are bound to LDLR.	Heterotrimer	-	PCSK9 mutations associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH3) are probably gain-of-function mutations (e.g. Asp-374-Tyr in the PCSK9's subtilisin-like catalytic domain) leading to increased affinity of PCSK9 towards LDLR and increased plasma LDL levels.

Mediates fast, short-lived, mainly pre-synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters. Major receptor in Central Nervous System and predominantly found in cerebellum, cortex, forebrain, hippocampus, mesencephalon, striatum, superior colliculus and thalamus. Up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example TNF-alpha.	The alpha4-beta2 complex is found with stoichiometry of 2:3 (CPX-2180) and 3:2; the 2:3-type is the receptor that is most sensitive to nicotine exposure and desensitisation. Upon chronic exposure it takes over from the 3:2-type. The 3:2-type is the acetylcholine receptor most permeable to Ca2+. The alpha subunit always supplies the ‘plus’-side of the ligand binding interface and determines ligand affinity whilst any subunit can supply the ‘minus’-binding side which determines ligand selectivity. At least two ligand binding sides are present. Each subunit has four transmembrane domains and the transmembrane domains line the channel, influencing channel conductance and ion selectivity. Signal sequences guide cotranslational assembly in the ER membrane. Palmitoylation of cysteine residues during assembly influences cell-specific expression on the plasma membrane.

Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC8/SUR1 subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs) and used to treat diabetic disorders. As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac and pancreatic channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in pancreatic beta-cells where glucose metabolism leads to an increase in intracellular ATP and a concomitant fall in MgADP causing closure of K+ channels, membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels which ultimately triggers insulin release.	The complex exists in two conformations. In the quatrefoil form, KATP is a symmetrical tetramer; each protomer consists of one K+ channel subunit and one ABC transporter. The K+ channel consists of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain, which form the ion pathway through the complex. At the molecular center, the four subunits of Kir6.2 form a canonical inward-rectifier K+ channel structure. In the propeller form, the position of the transporter module changes relative to the molecular centre. There are three different SUR subunits, SUR1 (ABCC8), SUR2A and SUR2B (ABCC9 isoforms 1 and 2). SUR1 channels are approximately 4-fold more ATP-sensitive than SUR2 channels.

Characterized by an excessive or uncontrolled insulin secretion and recurrent episodes of profound hypoglycemia requiring rapid and intensive treatment to prevent irreversible brain damage. Caused by loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ11/Kir6.2 and/of ABCC8/SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic K+ channel resulting in either defects of K+ channel trafficking to the surface membrane or disruption of channel gating by nucleotides ultimately causing permanent activity of the voltage-gated calcium channel leading to permanent insulin secretion and hypoglycemia.|neonatal diabetes mellitus with reduced insulin secretion and resultant hyperglycemia [Orphanet:224]: Neonatal diabetes mellitus presents as hyperglycemia, delayed development of speech and walking and muscle weakness and, in some cases, dehydration and ketoacidosis which may be severe with coma, in a child within the first months of life. Includes Transient (TNDM) [Orphanet:99886] and Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) [Orphanet:99885]. TNDM infants develop diabetes in the first few weeks of life but go into remission in a few months, with possible relapse to a permanent diabetes state usually around adolescence or as adults. The pancreatic dysfunction may be maintained throughout life, with relapse initiated at times of metabolic stress such as puberty or pregnancy. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early post-natal period, does not go into remission and requires continuous insulin treatment. The most extreme cases show Developmental delay-epilepsy-neonatal diabetes (DEND) [Orphanet:79134] syndrome, characterized by marked developmental delay, muscle weakness, epilepsy, dysmorphic feature, and neonatal diabetes, or Intermediate DEND syndrome (iDEND) [Orphanet:99989], a rare, mild form of DEND syndrome, characterised clinically by mild motor, speech or cognitive delay and an absence of epilepsy.

Required for the elongation of isolation membranes (phagophores). Acts as an E3-like enzyme to recruit the E2-like protein ATG3, conjugated to LC3-I, to the endoplasmic reticulum-derived omegasome. ATG3 binds to and is activated by ATG12, facilitating conjugation of the LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, thus converting LC3-I to LC3-II. Therefore, the site of ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex recruitment determines the site of LC3-II formation. The LC3 family is required for phagophore expansion, closure, and cargo recruitment.	ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide. Formation of the complex is mediated by ATG16L1 homo-oligomerization. Additionally ATG16L1 contains repeat WD40 domains, which facilitate the conjugation of LC3s to PE by recruiting other autophagic components onto the phagophore membrane and forming an approximately 800-kDa oligomeric complex, sedimentation studies suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry for ATG16L1 to ATG12-ATG5. Several isoforms exist for ATG16L1 the distribution of which may be tissue-dependent. 	-	-	Associated with Crohn's Disease [EFO:0000384], a chronic transmural inflammation that may involve any part of the digestive tract from mouth to anus, mostly found in the ileum, the cecum, and the colon.

Mediates fast, short-lived synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction.	Consists of 5 subunits, 2x(alpha1), beta1, epsilon and delta subunits.alpha-epsilon and alpha-delta subunit interfaces form the ligand binding sites.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop.

Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times.

Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell.

As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections.

Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria.

Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	-	amiloride (CHEBI:2639)|zinc ion (Zn2+, CHEBI:29105)	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P51168(0)|P51170(0)|P51172(0)

Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 binds to and clusters ubiquitinated cargo for delivery into MVBs, and recruits clathrin, ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes.. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission. Disassembly of ESCRT-III by VPS4A/B may be a required step for fission. CHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP5 are sometimes regarded as ESCRT-III accessory proteins rather than full complex members, suggesting that multiple variants with different core components and/or associated auxiliary factors may exist within the same cell and be active in different processes.	Monomers of ESCRT-III components take on a closed, self-inhibitory conformation. They are soluble owning to their N-terminal basic and C-terminal acidic regions that form tightly packed, helical hairpins. Structural studies suggest all ESCRT-III subunits are likely to adopt the 4-helix bundle configuration, with a fifth helix connected by a highly flexible linker. Subunits CHMP3 and CHMP6 facilitate anchorage of ESCRT-III to the membrane via the interaction of CHMP3 with phosphatidylinositol phosphate, releasing the conformational inhibition and allowing the complex to assemble into higher-order structures.	-	-	Neurodegenerative disease [EFO:0005772]: A disorder of the central nervous system characterized by gradual and progressive loss of neural tissue and neurological function.

Multiple disassembly reactions are performed until ESCRT-III dissociation has been completed. VPS4 ATPase activity is regulated by a) ESCRT-III interactions with VPS4 which enhance ATP hydrolysis by relieving autoinhibition of the AAA domain and b) binding of the VTA1 homodimers (Q9NP79) which both promotes VPS4 oligomerization and enhances ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ESCRT-III subunits CHMP1B (Q7LBR1) or CHMP5 (Q9NZZ3) to the amino-terminal of VTA1 relieves autoinhibition within VTA1 to further enhance stimulation of VPS4 ATP hydrolysis.

Selectively cleaves the linkage between a glucuronic acid unit and an N-sulfo glucosamine unit of HSPGs carrying either a 3-O-sulfo, a 6-O-sulfo or a 2-O-sulfo group, but not linkages between a glucuronic acid unit and a 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid moiety. HS sulfation serves as a molecular signal that directs heparanase to cleave only certain glycan sites and acts as mechanistic handles by which the enzyme can prize open the substrate HS helix and more effectively access the trisaccharide cleavage site via heparanase-binding induced distortion of the substrate helix. Present in a variety of cellular locations where it performs an essential housekeeping role in catabolic processing of internalized HSPGs and at the cell surface or released into the ECM where it participates in ECM degradation and remodeling. HSPGs ensure that bioactive molecules such as growth factors, chemokines, lipoproteins, and enzymes are localized to the cell surface and ECM and function in the control of normal and pathological processes. These include morphogenesis, osteogenesis, hair follicle inner root sheath differentiation and hair homeostasis, wound healing, shedding of syndecans, inflammation, pre-eclampsia, autoimmunity, cell proliferation and migration associated with metastasis, endothelial invasion and angiogenesis. Cleavage of HSPGs is likely to release these regulators that can alter the functional state of tissues and provide a mechanism by which cells can respond rapidly to changes in the extracellular environment. The proliferative advantages conferred by heparanase lead to its up-regulation in tumors in a variety of tissues, and its over-expression correlates strongly with metastasis and worsened clinical prognoses. Also acts as pro-coagulant by increasing the generation of activation factor X in the presence of tissue factor and activation factor VII. Increases cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) independent of its enzymatic activity. HPSE is the only mammalian gene so far identified to have heparanase activity. 	Secreted as a latent enzyme and internalized into late endosomes or lysosomes where it is subjected to proteolytic cleavage and activation. Cleavage at Glu109-Ser110 and Gln157-Lys158 yields an N-terminal 8 kDa and a C-terminal 50 kDa polypeptide that combine to form the catalytic site. Subsequent exocytosis transports the heparanase to its target sites. Prior to cleavage, the linker between the the 8 kD and 50 kD proteolytic chains acts as a steric block.

Eukaryotic PDC is a highly organized multienzyme complex with the core structure formed by 60 subunits of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and 12 monomers of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3BP) to which other components of the complex are bound: 20-30 heterotetramers (alpha2beta2) of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), 6-12 homodimers of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), 1-2 homo (or hetero) dimers of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and 2-3 heterodimers of phosphopyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. E1 catalyzes the first irreversible and rate-limiting step in the PDC catalyzed reactions, i.e. the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent decarboxylation of pyruvic acid with formation of 2-a-hydroxyethylidene-TPP and carbon dioxide and reductive acetylation of lipoyl moieties of E2. Heterotetrameric E1 has two active sites that interact with each other during catalysis, each using TPP and magnesium ion as cofactors and each formed on the interface between the alpha and beta subunits.

The AMPK complex activates Cyclin Y/CDK16 to initiate an early step in the formation of autophagosomes.	CDKs have a two-lobed structure. The amino-terminal lobe contains beta-sheets, the carboxy-terminal lobe is rich in alpha-helices, and the active site is sandwiched in-between. In the cyclin-free, monomeric form the CDK catalytic cleft is closed by a region known as the T-loop, preventing enzymatic activity. Cyclin binding leads to a conformational change, enabling activation of catalytic activity. Unlike conventional cyclins, cyclin Y contains only a single cyclin fold.

It is involved in various processes related to chromatin dynamics: DNA replication, DNA damage and repair, transcription initiation and elongation. Binds histone H2A-H2B dimers and possibly small amounts of H3H4. Facilitates RNAPol II driven transcription through chromatin by destabilizing nucleosomal structure so that one of the H2A-H2B dimers is removed upon RNA Pol II passage. Subsequently brings back the histones and thereby maintains nucleosome integrity after RNA Pol II passage. Interacts with the active forms of the MCM complexes facilitating its unwinding activity. 	The acidic C-terminus of the SPT16 subunit (933-1047aa) is essential for the FACT-nucleosome interaction. SSRP1 residues 547-615 bind to DNA. Based on purification yields, it has been estimated that there are more than 100,000 molecules of FACT complex per cell.

A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (CPX-592) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (CPX-600), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (this complex), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (CPX-591) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (CPX-593). The nuclear RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3-prime end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin, immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR), Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes. A small amount of this complex has also been found in the cytoplasm. 	The RNA exosome contains a catalytically inactive but evolutionarily conserved core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9). This barrel-shaped Exo-9 is formed by a hexameric ring of RNase PH domain-containing subunits EXOSC4 (RRP41) - EXOSC9 (RRP45), EXOSC5 (RRP46) - EXOSC8 (RRP43) and EXOSC6 (MTR3) - EXOSC7 (RRP42), and a peripheral cap consisting of S1 domain-containing components EXOSC1 (CSL4), EXOSC2 (RRP4) and EXOSC3 (RRP40) located on the top of the ring structure. Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity although an active site created in the binding surface of EXOSC4-EXOSC9 may provide very low phosphorolytic activity. Exo-9 facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunits. Full ribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3 (RRP44) and EXOSC10 (RRP6) bind to the base of Exo-9 and to its cap-side, respectively. Manganese(2+) (Mn2+, CHEBI:29035) may replace Mg2+ as cofactor.

However, the activity of the one- and two-chain forms show minimal difference in rate when assayed in the presence of physiological levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen therefore the gene has been taken to indicate both forms in this entry.

The pregnane X receptor (NR1I2/PXR) is a central xenobiotic sensor that detects potentially toxic chemicals and regulates the expression of genes central to their breakdown and removal. NR1I2 binds as a heterodimer with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXRA) to xenobiotic response elements in cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) gene promoters and is activated by the spectrum of chemicals that are known to induce CYP3A gene expression. Like other NRs, RXRA and NR1I2 contain DNA-binding and ligand-binding domain (DBD, LBD). Upon ligand binding, corepressors dissociate from RXRA and transcriptional coactivators, such as NCOA1 (Q15788), are recruited leading to transcriptional activation. 	All RXRA heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXRA and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. NR1I2-RXRA unusually forms a symmetric heterotetramer composed of two NR1I2 and two RXRA LBD monomers. The two NR1I2 monomers form a homodimer with a unique curved pocket and two RXRA monomers bind to NR1I2, one per monomer. Unusually for class II nuclear receptors, RXRA also forms transcriptionally active homodimers (CPX-664) although their physiological significance is not clear. Molecular weight = 210 kDa.

The formation of this complex results in altered cell adhesion, migration, survival and proliferation. Components of the plasminogen activation system including urokinase plasminogen activator uPA (PLAU) and its cell surface receptor uPAR (PLAUR) have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes related to tissue homoeostasis. The high affinity binding of uPA regulates the binding of uPAR to matrix-embedded vitronectin. Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen, generating the protease plasmin. uPA and plasmin induces a potent negative feedback on cell adhesion through specific cleavage of the RGD motif in vitronectin. Cleavage of vitronectin by uPA requires concomitant binding of both uPA and vitronectin to uPAR. 	uPAR binds simultaneously to uPA and the somatomedin B domain (SMB) of vitronectin. uPA binding to uPAR is mediated by a 25-residue beta-turn growth factor-like (EGF) domain that is ensconced in a large hydrophobic cavity lined with several residues that contribute more than an order of magnitude to the binding. SMB binds to the outer side of the receptor. The uPAR-uPA interaction is a tight, approximately 1 nM, and long-lived complex that occurs over a large protein-protein interface of more than 1,000 A2. In contrast, the uPAR-VTN interaction occurs over a smaller interface of 75 A2. The binding of the SMB domain is a transient interaction with micromolar affinity that is uPA-dependent despite the lack of direct interaction between uPA and VTN. Studies have shown that VTN binds to uPAR but only in the presence of uPA suggesting a potential allosteric mechanism.	Heterotrimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(ceitec)	P00749(1)|P04004(1)|Q03405(1)

Facilitates the degradation of GAGs in lysosomes of the central and peripheral nervous system. Member of the Family 20 glycoside hydrolases (glycosidase). Active on water-soluble and amphiphilic glycoconjugates such as sulfated GAG fragments, and the sulfated glycosphingolipid SM2 (CHEBI:90163). Only the heterodimeric complex HEX A is able to remove N-acetylgalactosamine from the ganglioside GM2 (CHEBI:60327), a molecule composed of a glycosphingolipid with a single sialic acids linked on the sugar chain found in high concentrations in neuronal cell plasma membranes. Works in association with the GM2A (P17900) which extracts single GM2 molecules from membranes and presents them in soluble form to the enzyme or hydrolyses sulphated, membrane-bound substrates. Intra-lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside leads to severely debilitating neurodegeneration associated with Tay-Sachs disease, Sandoff disease and AB variant. 	An alpha-beta heterodimer, with each subunit having a functional active site. Beta subunit probably forms 2 chains. Only the alpha-subunit active site can hydrolyze GM2 gangliosides due to a flexible loop structure that is removed post-translationally from beta, and to the presence of Asn423 and Arg424 residues. The loop structure is involved in binding the GM2 activator protein, while alpha-Arg424 is critical for binding the carboxylate group of the N-acetyl-neuraminic acid residue of GM2. The beta-subunit lacks these key residues and has Asp452 and Leu453 in their place. The beta-subunit therefore cleaves only neutral substrates efficiently.

This enzymatic defect leads to abnormal GM2 ganglioside storage in neurons and peripheral tissues. Three variants have been described according to age of onset. The infantile form (type 1) begins between 3 and 6 months of age. The earliest sign is an incessant startle response to noise. Psychomotor retardation appears after the age of 8 months with hypotonia, amaurosis, and megalencephaly. A cherry-red macular spot may be found but is not specific. Muscular weakness progresses and leads to paralysis. The disorder degenerates into a state of decerebration and is fatal during childhood. Enzymatic activity of the hexosaminidase A is either extremely low or totally absent in leucocytes and cultured in fibroblasts obtained by skin biopsy. In the juvenile form (type 2), onset is between ages 2 and 6 with locomotor ataxia, behavioural disorders, and progressive loss of intellectual capacities, leading to a state of decerebration and death at around the age of 15. The decrease in hexosaminidase A activity is less pronounced than in the infantile form. The adult or chronic form (type 3) may begin around the age of 10, but often the disorder is not diagnosed until adulthood. Two different clinical forms exist. The first is similar to atypical Friedreich disease, with spinocerebellar ataxia but no cardiac or osseous signs, such as scoliosis or flat feet. The second is that of juvenile spinal amyotrophy resembling Kugelberg-Welander's syndrome. Mental capacities and behaviour may or may not be affected.|Sandhoff disease (GM2 gangliosidosis 0 variant, Hexosaminidases A and B deficiency) [Orphanet:796]: an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, linked to an abnormal beta subunit (while Tay-Sachs disease results from hexosaminidase A deficiency caused by an abnormal alpha subunit). This enzymatic defect leads to abnormal GM2 ganglioside storage in neurons and peripheral tissues. The clinical picture is identical to that of Tay-Sachs disease, with startle reactions, early blindness, progressive motor and mental deterioration, macrocephaly and cherry-red spots on the macula. Patients may have a doll-like face, hepatosplenomegaly and recurring respiratory tract infections. High levels of urinary oligosaccharides are found. Children develop normally during the first 3-6 months of life, after which the disease appears and evolves quickly. Death usually occurring by age of 4 years. In cases with later onset, or in adult cases, signs may be those of spinocerebellous ataxia or dystonia.

The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. In the absence of RAR agonist, the RXR-RAR heterodimer recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription. RXRA-RARA is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, RARA. Upon RAR agonist binding, corepressors are released, and coactivator complexes such as histone acetyltransferases or histone arginine methyltransferases are recruited to activate transcription. The RXR-RAR heterodimer binds more efficiently to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), composed typically of two direct repeats of a core hexameric motif, PuG [G/T] TCA, than do either of the homodimeric forms of RXR or RAR.

Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase pumps protons into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase). The low potential chain consists of two cyt b hemes, which serve as a pathway through which electrons are transferred across the coupling membrane.

CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1 (P06493), CDK2 (P24941), CDK4 (P11802) and CDK6 Q00534) by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK activity is itself regulated throughout the cell cycle by T-loop phosphorylation of CDK7 on Thr-170. Phosphorylation of Ser-164 during mitosis inactivates the enzyme. In the transcription cycle, CAK serine phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A, P24928) and other proteins, as part of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. CAK also phosphorylates CDK9 (P-TEFb, P50750), which releases POLR2A from the promoter and and enables elongation of the transcripts.	MAT1 substantially extends the interaction interface between CDK7 and cyclin H, promoting the extended conformation of the CDK7 T-loop within the CAK complex, which probably contributes to CAK activation.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P50613(1)|P51946(1)|P51948(1)

Preferentially cleaves four-way DNA junctions, such as nicked Holliday Junctions (nHJs), D-loops, 3-prime flap DNA substrates and splayed-arm DNA (not found in MUS81-EME complex) that contain an exposed 5-prime DNA strand end at or close to the junction crossover point and replication forks, via the “nick and counternick” mechanism. DNA binding induces conformational changes in the linkers connecting the nuclease and HhH2 domains of MUS81 and EME2, which transforms the complex from a compact to an open state. These changes unmask the hydrophobic wedge that separates pre‐ and post‐nick duplex and create the 5-prime end binding pocket facilitating the DNA substrate bending by the complex, ultimately placing the incision strand at the active site of MUS81. 	-	Heterodimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	A4GXA9(1)|Q96NY9(1)

The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates the transcriptional effects of Vitamin D and plays a central role in calcium homeostasis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to hormone response elements (HREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded VDR can occupy its response elements as a homodimer. RXRA-VDR is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, VDR. Upon binding of ligand, VDR forms a heterodimer with RXRA through their LBDs and binds to Vitamin D response elements. The ligand for RXRA, 9-cis retinoic acid, has the opposite effect of destabilizing the heterodimeric-DNA complex.	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-VDR complexes preferentially bind DR3. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable.

The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The effects of ligands on LXR, RXR, and other NRs are mediated through the ligand-binding domain (LBD). RXRA-LXRA is a permissive receptor that can be activated by the ligands of either partner. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. 	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-LXR complexes preferentially bind DR4. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. RXR-LXR complexes preferentially bind DR4. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. The LBDs share a common, mainly alpha-helical, fold that embeds a hydrophopic ligand-binding pocket. Ligands can affect the conformation of the ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) residing in the C-terminal alpha helix. An agonist allows this alpha helix to cover the ligand-binding pocket, thereby providing one of the sides in the coactivator-binding pocket. Conversely, an antagonist induces a conformation change blocking the coactivator-binding site and/or leading to recruitment of corepressors.

AKAP5 balances the opposing effects of calcineurin and protein kinase A (PKA) (P17612) on neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and coordinates the activities of calcineurin, PKA and PKC on a number of other channels and receptors. Despite its atypical PxIxIT calcineurin-recognition motif that confers stronger binding affinity by calcineurin than other substrates it allows for effective disengagement of calcineurin to couple channel activation with downstream signaling events. The calcineurin-AKAP5 complex has been shown to promote NFAT signaling. 	Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of calcineurin A (PPP3CA) and calcineurin B (PPP3R1) subunits. Binding of AKAP5 occurs along beta-strand 14 of calcineurin A subunit.	Heterotetramer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(ceitec)	P24588(1)|P62158(1)|P63098(1)|Q08209(1)

The complement system is a part of the innate immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism. The complex is formed after C5 cleavage by C5 convertase into C5a and C5b. C5b has a transient binding site for C6. Without C6 binding, C5b will irreversibly decay to a state incapable of binding C6. The complex initiates pore formation via the sequential recruitment of homologous proteins: C7, C8, and 12-18 copies of C9, each of which comprises a central MAC-perforin domain flanked by auxiliary domains. Activation of the complement system results in formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs), pores that disrupt lipid bilayers and lyse bacteria and other pathogens.

Key modulator of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis and immune responses. Liver X receptors (LXR) function as lipid-activated transcription factors that mediate cholesterol, glucose and lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The effects of ligands on LXR, RXR, and other NRs are mediated through the ligand-binding domain (LBD). RXRA-LXRB is a permissive receptor that can be activated by the ligands of either partner. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. 	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-LXR complexes preferentially bind DR4. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. The LBDs share a common, mainly alpha-helical, fold that embeds a hydrophopic ligand-binding pocket. Ligands can affect the conformation of the ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) residing in the C-terminal alpha helix. An agonist allows this alpha helix to cover the ligand-binding pocket, thereby providing one of the sides in the coactivator-binding pocket. Conversely, an antagonist induces a conformation change blocking the coactivator-binding site and/or leading to recruitment of corepressors.

Deposited by spliceosomes at a conserved position of a pre-messenger RNA strand located upstream of exon junctions formed during RNA splicing. The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle is exported to the cytoplasm, potentially promoting export through its close association with the TREX complex. Binds RNA primarily through EIF4A3, a sequence-independent DEAD box protein that grasps RNA stably only when associated with its partners, RBM8A/Y14 and MAGOHB which inhibit the DEAD-box protein EIF4A3 ATPase activity, trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The EJC core serves as a binding platform for additional factors which together then interface with numerous machineries controlling mRNA export, translation, and decay. Discriminates between premature and normal translation termination events by providing architectural information regarding the position of (former) introns. When translation terminates on an mRNA upstream of at least one EJC, UPF3 (Q9H1J1/Q9BZI7) and its cofactors UPF1 (Q9H1J1) and UPF2 (Q9HAU5) orchestrate a series of events that destabilize the message by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Also enhances translation of newly synthesized mRNAs through interactions between POLDIP3 (Q9BY77) and activated S6-kinase.	The EJC structure resembles an L-shaped molecule structurally divided into two binary complexes EIF4A3-Btz at the base of the assembly and MAGOHB-Y14 arranged almost perpendicularly to it. The alpha-helical surface of MAGOHB interacts with the beta-sheet surface of the RNA binding domain of Y14. The domain organization of EIF4A3 is typical of the DEAD-box family of proteins, with two RecA-like domains that are arranged to form a deep interdomain cleft where ATP binds. Single-stranded RNA binds with an overall bent conformation in a shallow cleft across the two RecA-like domains and is flanked on one side by Btz. Btz extends with two separate stretches over both domains of eIF4A3 and also contacts MAGOHB. The MAGOHB-Y14 heterodimer interacts mainly with domain 2 of EIF4A3 but also docks into the interdomain cleft.

Liver X receptors (LXR) function as transcription factors that mediate cholesterol, glucose and lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The effects of ligands on LXR, RXR, and other NRs are mediated through the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. 	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter‐half‐site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. RXR-LXR complexes preferentially bind DR4. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. The LBDs share a common, mainly alpha-helical, fold that embeds a hydrophopic ligand-binding pocket. Ligands can affect the conformation of the ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) residing in the C-terminal alpha helix. An agonist allows this alpha helix to cover the ligand-binding pocket, thereby providing one of the sides in the coactivator-binding pocket. Conversely, an antagonist induces a conformation change blocking the coactivator-binding site and/or leading to recruitment of corepressors.

The assembly of focal adhesions requires the recruitment and activation of vinculin which is is present in the cytoplasm in an autoinhibited conformation with its tail is held in a pincer by its head domains, further stabilized by two high-affinity head-tail interfaces. Vinculin isactivated by talin, modulated by tensile force generated by transient associations with F-actin which leads to release of its head-tail associations. The complex helps to link integrins to the actomyosin contractile machinery. Binding of the talin head to integrins regulates their affinity for the extracellular matrix, maintains integrins in an active conformation and stabilizes the entire focal adhesion structure which contains multiple signalling components. 	The C-terminal talin rod contains eleven buried amphipathic alpha-helices coined vinculin binding sites (VBSs) that reside within numerous four- and five-helix bundle domains that comprise the central talin rod, which are released from their buried locales by means of mechanical tension on the integrin:talin complex. In turn, these VBSs bind to the N-terminal seven-helix bundle domain of vinculin, creating an entirely new helix bundle that severs its head-tail interactions,thus activation vinculin..

The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. A general model of RAR-RXR-mediated transcription proposes that unliganded RAR-RXR heterodimers are bound to regulatory elements of their target genes and interact with transcriptional repressor complexes such as NCOR/SMRT/SIN3 to recruit histone deacetylases that lead to repression of target gene transcription. Binding of agonist ligand to the nuclear receptor, triggers a conformational change in the ligand binding domain (LBD) with the repositioning of the C-terminal helix H12 creating a binding surface that allow coactivator to bind. Antagonist ligands that prevent the C-terminal helix H12 from adopting its active conformation facilitate the interactions with corepressors.	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-RAR complexes preferentially bind DR2 and DR5 but also associates with DR1 under specific conditions. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. Coactivator proteins like NCOA2 contain one or more consensus LXXLL (where X is any amino acid) motifs that form an alpha-helix that fits into the hydrophobic cleft on the LBD to allow activation of target genes.

The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates the transcriptional effects of Vitamin D and plays a central role in calcium homeostasis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to hormone response elements (HREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded VDR can occupy its response elements as a homodimer. RXRB-VDR is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, VDR. Upon binding of ligand, VDR forms a heterodimer with RXRB through their LBDs and binds to Vitamin D response elements. The ligand for RXRB, 9-cis retinoic acid, has the opposite effect of destabilizing the heterodimeric-DNA complex.	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-VDR complexes preferentially bind DR3. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable.

It regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, making chromatin more compact by removing acetyl groups from nucleosomes, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression and DNA damage repair. The core of the complex is composed of six groups of proteins, each one with several paralogues (HDAC1/2, MTA1/2/3, RBBP4/7, GATAD2A/B, MBD2, and CHD3/4). Combinatorial assembly of these isoforms contributes to the targeting and function of the complex. It is currently not known whether GATAD2A/GATAD2B, RBBP4/RBBP7, and MTA1/MTA2/MTA3 form heterodimers/trimers or mutually exclusive homodimers/trimers. The CHD3/4 ATPase, utilizes energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for DNA sliding and repositioning of nucleosomes. The second catalytic subunit, HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylase), deacetylates acetylated lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. This dual enzymatic activity is proposed to be important for the efficient formation of heterochromatin with densely packed hypoacetylated nucleosomes and the rapid termination of gene transcription.

Composed by binding of the extracellular domains of two presynaptic neurexin proteins and two postsynaptic neuroligin proteins. Expression of both subunits is regulated by neuronal activity. Required for synaptic differentiation, maturation and maintenance, dendritic spine remodelling and axon arborisation. Possibly required for synapse formation. Mediates bidirectional synaptic signalling and coupling of presynaptic, Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis (= neurotransmitter release) with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor recruitment. Acts as a molecular switch between excitatory and inhibitory synapses: this complex acts primarily, but not exclusively, on GABAergic, inhibitory synapses that mainly release neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. Mainly found in synaptic clefts of the central nervous system but also at neuromuscular junctions (particularly alpha neurexin-containing complexes). Mutations in the neuroligin dimer interface as well as allosteric affects of mutation in both subunits affect spacial and fear-associated memory and result in autism-related disorders, mental retardation disorders and schizophrenia. 	Heterotetramer composed of 2 neuroligin and 2 neurexin subunits. Each neurexin monomer binds to opposite sites of the central neuroligin dimer in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The effect of Ca2+ on the intermolecular binding is proposed to be allosteric as Ca2+ does not bind directly to neuroligin residues. The subunits bind to each other via the neuroligin ACHE domain and neurexin LNS domains (LNS6 of alpha-neurexins and sole LNS of beta-neurexins). In mammals, there are 3-5 neuroligin genes and 3 neurexin genes. Neuroligin 4 (= neuroligin X) and neuroligin Y have only been characterised in human, with little information available for neuroligin Y. Neuroligin 1 contains 2 splice sites (SSA & SSB), neuroligins 2 & 3 contain 1 splice site (SSA) and neuroligin 4/X probably contains no splice site. Each neurexin gene produces from independent promoters a longer alpha- and a shorter beta neurexin isoform. Alpha-neurexins contain 5 splice sites (SS1-SS5) and beta-neurexins contain 2 splice sites (SS4 & SS5) which leads to almost 4000 potential neurexin variants alone. The most common variants affecting binding and function are restricted to the presence or absence of neuroligin SSB (restricted to neuroligin 1) and neurexin SS4. These combinations are curated in this resource. N-glycosylation of neuroligin SSB (mainly on Asn300 [count based on NLGN1+SSA+SSB]) reduces binding to beta-neurexin SS4 and abolishes binding to alpha-neurexin SS4 as the intermolecular interfaces are proximal to these respective splice insertions.

The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while TAF1 and TAF2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and TAF1 and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-519) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-79), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: TAF1 bromodomains (1361-1617 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. TAF1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. TAF3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. TAF1 phosphorylates TP53 (P04637) on Thr-55, leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression. Spermatocytes contain variants of TAF-containing complexes, including the TAF4B variant (CPX-930). 	TFIID can be divided into three lobes, A, B and C which arrange around a central cavity. The conformation of lobe A relative to lobes B and C changes as TFIID binds to both, TFIIA (CPX-519) and the core promoter, enhancing its DNA-binding capacity. In the canonical (or unbound) state, TATA-box binding protein TBP of lobe A binds the TAF1-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C. Binding of TFIIA complex to TBP forms the rearranged (or promoter-bound) state, whereby lobe A is released from lobe C and binds proximal to lobe B and to the TATA-box. During this conformational change TBP is released from binding to TAF1 but its B lobe binding partner(s) are as yet to be determined. Lobe C contains at least TAF1, TAF2, TAF6, TAF7 and TAF8. The winged helix domain of TAF1 forms a major interaction at the junction of the downstream promoter elements MTE and DPE and the aminopeptidase-like domain (APD) of TAF2 domain 3 interacts with the MTE. TAF6 forms a homodimer that, together with TAF8, binds TAF2 of lobe C to lobe B. A core complex, formed by histone-fold domain (HFD)-containing subunits from lobes B and C, links the TAF1-TAF2-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C to lobe A. It contains at least the HFD-containing heterodimers TAF4-TAF12 (x2), TAF6-TAF9 (x2), TAF8-TAF10 and TAF11-TAF13 as well as two TAF5 subunits that appear to form the scaffold for the heterodimers. However, the HFD-containing heterodimers may be too far apart from each other to form histone-like tetramer and octamer structures. The core complex forms a clamp in which the remaining subunits assemble dynamically. TAF4 can be replaced by TAF4B (Q92750) with TFIID remaining functional. TAF7 may get released from the PIC without loosing complex integrity and transcription initiation.

It regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, making chromatin more compact by removing acetyl groups from nucleosomes, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression, DNA damage repair and cell differentiation. The core of the complex is composed of six groups of proteins, each one with several paralogues (HDAC1/2, MTA1/2/3, RBBP4/7, GATAD2A/B, MBD3, and CHD3/4). Combinatorial assembly of these isoforms contributes to the targeting and function of the complex. It is currently not known whether GATAD2A/GATAD2B, RBBP4/RBBP7, and MTA1/MTA2/MTA3 form heterodimers/trimers or mutually exclusive homodimers/trimers. The CHD3/4 ATPase, utilizes energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for DNA sliding and repositioning of nucleosomes. The second catalytic subunit, HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylase), deacetylates acetylated lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. This dual enzymatic activity is proposed to be important for the efficient formation of heterochromatin with densely packed hypoacetylated nucleosomes and the rapid termination of gene transcription. In addition to the well-described core subunits, a large number of proteins have been reported to interact with the NuRD complex, like DOC1 (O14519), KPNA2 (P52292), ZMYND8(Q9ULU4), ZNF512B/532/592/687(Q96KM6, Q9HCE3, Q92610, Q8N1G0), SALL4 (Q9UJQ4), PRMT5 (O14744), MEP50 (Q9BQA1).

The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while TAF1 and TAF2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and TAF1 and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-519) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-79), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: TAF1 bromodomains (1361-1617 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. TAF1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. TAF3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. TAF1 phosphorylates TP53 (P046370) on Thr-55, leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression. 	Variant of the canonical TFIID complex (CPX-915) containing TAF4B instead of TAF4. Thought to have the same function as the canonical complex. TFIID can be divided into three lobes, A, B and C which arrange around a central cavity. The conformation of lobe A relative to lobes B and C changes as TFIID binds to both, TFIIA (CPX-519) and the core promoter, enhancing its DNA-binding capacity. In the canonical (or unbound) state, TATA-box binding protein TBP of lobe A binds the TAF1-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C. Binding of TFIIA complex to TBP forms the rearranged (or promoter-bound) state, whereby lobe A is released from lobe C and binds proximal to lobe B and to the TATA-box. During this conformational change TBP is released from binding to TAF1 but its B lobe binding partner(s) are as yet to be determined. Lobe C contains at least TAF1, TAF2, TAF6, TAF7 and TAF8. The winged helix domain of TAF1 forms a major interaction at the junction of the downstream promoter elements MTE and DPE and the aminopeptidase-like domain (APD) of TAF2 domain 3 interacts with the MTE. TAF6 forms a homodimer that, together with TAF8, binds TAF2 of lobe C to lobe B. A core complex, formed by histone-fold domain (HFD)-containing subunits from lobes B and C, links the TAF1-TAF2-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C to lobe A. It contains at least the HFD-containing heterodimers TAF4B-TAF12 (x2), TAF6-TAF9 (x2), TAF8-TAF10 and TAF11-TAF13 as well as two TAF5 subunits that appear to form the scaffold for the heterodimers. However, the HFD-containing heterodimers may be too far apart from each other to form histone-like tetramer and octamer structures. The core complex forms a clamp in which the remaining subunits assemble dynamically. TAF7 may get released from the PIC without loosing complex integrity and transcription initiation.

Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. Activation by autocatalytic cleavage is an ATP-dependent reaction and occurs within an activation platform, the Inflammasome (CPX-4141, CPX-4082, CPX-4144, CPX-4142 and CPX-4143). Once activated, it has a strict requirement for an Asp residue at position P1 and preferred cleavage sequence of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-|-. It cleaves interleukins 1beta (IL1B, P01584) and IL18 (Q14116) between an Asp and an Ala, releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes. Cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). Related to, but independent of, IL1B activation it is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves GSDMD (P57764). However, as a side effect of pyroptosis active IL1B is often released form the dead cells and therefore some link exists between both activities. While primarily a pro-inflammatory caspase it can also promote apoptosis in non-immune cells, especially in response to brain, kidney and renal cell injury.

Genotoxic stress, mitotic catastrophe, heat shock, ER stress or bacterial toxins can stimulate Caspase-2 activation. It is activated by autocatalytic cleavage in the Caspase-2-PIDDosome (CPX-3905). Once activated, it is released from the PIDDosome and induces BID (P55957) cleavage, BAX (Q07812) translocation to mitochondria, subsequent Cytochrome c (P99999) release and consequent activation of the apoptotic process. Specifically cleaves substrates with an aspartic acid residue at position P1 and has a preferred cleavage sequence of Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|-. In addition, Caspase-2 has been reported to be a negative regulator of necroptosis and to be indispensable for correct cell proliferation and genomic stability acting as a potential tumor suppressor factor. Caspase-2 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at distinct sites (Ser157 and Ser340) during cell division and in nutrient abundance conditions. In response to heat shock, Caspase-2 activity is suppressed by the chaperone HSP90AA1(P07900). Decreased level of Caspase-2 associated with childhood forms of drug-resistance acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and decreased Caspase-2 expression was observed in mantle cell lymphoma tumor samples. Caspase-2 is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington'd diseases. 	Caspase-2 consists of anti-parallel arranged heterodimers of p12/p18 subunits.

Complement C3 precurser is activated by cleavage into C3a and C3b by C3 convertases, either C4bC2a in the classical and lectin pathways or C3(H2O)Bb, C3bBb, C3bBbC3b, C3bBbP or C3bBbC3bP in the alternative pathway. C3b acts as an opsonin and interacts with glycoproteins and carbohydrates on pathogenic or apoptotic target cell surfaces through its reactive thioester moiety. Opsonization of target cells leads to enhanced phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex (CPX-6159) assembly, clearance of antibody-antigen complexes and up-regulation of the adaptive response. Activation of C3b leads to an amplification cascade that generates more C3 convertase, deposits more C3b at the local site and switches C3 convertases to C5 convertases. To protect host cells from inadvertent complement activation the activation of C3b is tightly regulated by either disrupting the C3 convertases or aiding in the proteolytic degradation of C3b. Bacteria and viruses possess C3b proteases to evade the complement response. Lack of protection, due to familial mutations in the complement genes or the presence of autoantibodies against regulators has been linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) in kidneys and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes. Conditions of chronic and acute inflammations, as in rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, and heart attacks, become aggravated by complement activation against the disturbed tissue.	The alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level. C3 precursor is first processed by the removal of 4 Arg residues and spontaneous hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond forms C3(H2O) (disulfide bonded P01024-PRO_0000005909 & P01024-PRO_0000005908). C3(H2O) subsequently binds factor B that is cleaved by Factor D (P00746) into 2 fragments: CFBa and CFBb. CFBb, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor C3(H2O) or C3b to generate the C3 or C5 convertases. Proteolytic cleavage of C3 to C3b is accompanied by large conformational changes that result in the exposure of cryptic binding sites required for convertase assembly and regulation. This includes a significant movement of the thioester-bond-containing domain through which C3b attaches to target surfaces.

Deficiency leads to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). 	Caspase-8 p18 and p10 subunits are folded into a compact cylinder of ~28 x 37 x 48 A. The protein has an alpha/beta folding motif with a central six-stranded beta-sheet with five parallel strands and one antiparallel strand. In the heterotetramer, the first segment of the p10 subunit and the last segment of the p18 subunit extend from the compact structure in an antiparallel fashion and interact with the other heterodimer. The approximate area of the solvent accessible interface between the two dimers is 2100 A^2.

Examples of regulated genes include TP53 (P04637)-dependent transcription genes, those containing promoters regulated by MYC (P01106) and highly transcribed genes such as those encoding ribosomal proteins. The major acetylation targets are lysines-5, 8, and 12 on nucleosomal H4, K5 and K15 on H2A, histone variants H2AZ and H2AX, as well as non-histone substrates such as TP53. The NuA4 complex can also acetylate H3 in free histones. A core complex formed by the subunits KAT5, EPC1, and ING3 is sufficient to enable strong HAT activity on nucleosomal templates (Piccolo NuA4 CPX-709).

Calcineurin is important for cardiac development and pathophysiology, for nervous-system development and for some of the plastic changes in neurons that are believed to underlie learning and memory. AKAP5 recruits calcineurin to the vicinity of L-type Ca2+ channels for their activation by elevated Ca2+ entering the cell.

Important for many cellular activities such as homeostasis, angiogenesis, myogenesis, adipogenesis, osteogenesis, chondrocyte differentiation, cardiovascular system development, pancreatic beta-cell proliferation, hair follicle cell differentiation and remodeling, and activities of cells of the immune. Plays a pivotal role during nervous system development and in various functions of mature central and peripheral nervous system. Regulates the NFAT signaling cascade by binding to and dephosphorylating NFAT leading to nuclear translocation of this larger complex and increasing the DNA-binding affinity of the NFAT family of transcription factors. Calcineurin also promotes nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) and preventing NES-dependent nuclear export. Altered calcineurin-NFAT activation can mediate both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative signals and is linked to pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons, Parkinsons, and Alzheimers diseases. Modulates Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. CDI is initiated by Ca2+ binding to channel-associated calmodulin and subsequent activation of calcineurin, which is targeted to L channels by the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP5 (CPX-674). Channel activity is activated by phosphorylation of AKAP5-bound Protein Kinase A.	Calcineurin substrates share a recognition sequence of the formula PxIxIT. At low calcium concentrations, the catalytic subunit (CnA) PPP3CA exists in an inactive state, where the autoinhibitory domain (AID) binds to the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain.

Regulates the NFAT signaling cascade by binding to and dephosphorylating NFAT leading to nuclear translocation of this larger complex and increasing the DNA-binding affinity of the NFAT family of transcription factors. Calcineurin also promotes nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) and preventing NES-dependent nuclear export. Altered calcineurin-NFAT activation can mediate both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative signals and is linked to pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons, Parkinsons, and Alzheimers diseases. Modulates Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. CDI is initiated by Ca2+ binding to channel-associated calmodulin and subsequent activation of calcineurin, which is targeted to L channels by the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP5 (CPX-674). Channel activity is activated by phosphorylation of AKAP5-bound Protein Kinase A.	Calcineurin substrates share a recognition sequence of the formula PxIxIT.

May have a role in depressing synaptic activity thus preventing excitotoxicity. Influences synaptic plasticity through various receptors, including NMDAR, mGluR and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CPX-236). Mediates dendritic spine loss leading to decreased synapse density, inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), enhancement of long-term depression (LTD), excessive calcium influx and mitochondrial impairment. May affect metal ion homeostasis by celating synaptic copper, zinc or iron ions. Oligomers of protein 42 only may have positive neurogenetic effects by activating synaptic protein kinases. Mostly found in the extracellular space with a small proportion occurring as membrane-bound species. Dimers and oligomers of soluble amyloid-beta peptides are the main pathogenic species linked to Alzheimer's disease. Insoluble fibrils and plaques form during the latter stages of the disease. Chaperones, such as alphaB-crystallins or clusterin (P10909), bind to misfolded oligomeric species and form long-lived complexes, thereby preventing both their further growth into fibrils and their dissociation into synaptotoxic dimers. Amyloid-beta peptide may act as transcription factor for its own precursor protein APP and its cleavage enzyme BACE1 (P56817) initiating a positive feedback mechanism that ultimately leads to amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease.	Amyloid-beta protein 42 dimers are the smallest synaptotoxic species of the amyloid beta A4 protein and are inherently less thermodynamically stable than their oligomeric forms.

Positively regulates histone H3 acetylation, in particular H3K9, by recruiting several histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as KAT2B (PCAF, Q92831), p300 (Q09472), and KAT2A (GCN5, Q92830). Binds to both ribosomal DNA promoters and coding regions. Facilitates RNA polymerase I and III transcription by preventing compaction of chromatin at rDNA loci allowing HATs to assemble. An open chromatin structure is a prerequisite for the binding of the RNA polymerase machinery and also the regulatory factor MYC (P01106), which activates both RNA pol I genes and RNA pol III genes. May also activate RNA polymerase II gene transcription. The different subunits of the complex potentially have specific roles that lead to the stepwise modification of chromatin, and may not all associate simultaneously with the BAZ1B-SMARCA5 core. The B-WICH assembly may thus represent a number of smaller complexes. At the start of the cell division process, when Pol I transcription is arrested, B-WICH is in a disassembled state due to the phosphorylation of BAZ1B. The complex assembles on the active gene during early G1 phase. Polymeric actin interacts with Pol I, an interaction that is required for transcription. One speculative model is that NM1 (O00159-3) interacts with actin and the rDNA via its C-terminus, generating local force that pulls the polymerase along the active gene. Once dissociated from actin, NM1 interacts with SMARCA5 in a BAZ1B-dependent manner, a mechanism that stabilizes the complex on the rDNA. Additional components then assemble into the B-WICH complex(es) mediated by specific RNA species. Particularly important during embryonic and neonatal development, especially for craniofacial features. 	NM1 (via its c-terminus) and SMARCA5 bind the complex to promoter and gene regions of several rDNAs. Binds several RNAs, among others: 5S rRNA, 7SL RNA, and 45S rRNA. SIRT7 (Q9NRC8) or RRN3 (TIFIA, Q9NYV6) may facilitate interaction of B-WICH with pol I. 	-	-	Williams-Beuren syndrome (Orphanet:904): a rare genetic disease characterised by a developmental disorder associating a cardiac malformation (most frequently supra valvular aortic stenosis, SVAS) in 75% of cases, psychomotor retardation, a characteristic facial dysmorphism and a specific cognitive and behavioural profile. BAZ1B is located in the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) critical region. WBS results from a hemizygous deletion of several genes on chromosome 7q11.23, thought to arise as a consequence of unequal crossing over between highly homologous low-copy repeat sequences flanking the deleted region..

Calcineurin is important for cardiac development and pathophysiology, for nervous-system development and for some of the plastic changes in neurons that are believed to underlie learning and memory. AKAP5 recruits calcineurin to the vicinity of L-type Ca2+ channels for their activation by elevated Ca2+ entering the cell. AKAP5 balances the opposing effects of calcineurin and protein kinase A (PKA) (P17612) on neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and coordinates the activities of calcineurin, PKA and PKC on a number of other channels and receptors. Despite its atypical PxIxIT calcineurin-recognition motif that confers stronger binding affinity by calcineurin than other substrates it allows for effective disengagement of calcineurin to couple channel activation with downstream signaling events.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. Regulates cell differentiation in several lineages, such as T cells and myocytes, and specific variants exist in embryonic stem cells (esBAF) and neuronal progenitor cells (npBAF). Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1204) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) also may not co-occur.

Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa.

May have a role in depressing synaptic activity thus preventing excitotoxicity. Influences synaptic plasticity through various receptors, including NMDAR, mGluR and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CPX-236). Mediates dendritic spine loss leading to decreased synapse density, inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), enhancement of long-term depression (LTD), excessive calcium influx, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of apoptotic processes. May bind plasma membrane lipids affecting their stability and leading to cytotoxicity. May affect metal ion homeostasis by chelating synaptic copper, zinc or iron ions. Mostly found in the extracellular space with a small proportion occurring as membrane-bound species. Dimers (CPX-1069) and oligomers of soluble amyloid-beta peptides are the main pathogenic species linked to Alzheimer's disease. Cellular prion protein (PrPC/PRNP, P04156) binds amyloid-beta oligomers mediating their synaptic dysfunction. Insoluble fibrils and plaques form during the latter stages of the disease. Chaperones, such as alphaB-crystallins or clusterin (P10909), bind to misfolded oligomeric species and form long-lived complexes, thereby preventing both their further growth into fibrils and their dissociation into synaptotoxic dimers. Amyloid-beta peptide may act as transcription factor for its own precursor protein APP and its cleavage enzyme BACE1 (P56817) initiating a positive feedback mechanism that ultimately leads to amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease. 	Many forms of amyloid-beta oligomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium: from low-n amyloid-beta oligomer complexes such as dimers and trimers to high-n amyloid-beta oligomer complexes, such as pre-fibrilar and fibrilar oligomers to inactive fibrils. Pre-fibrilar oligomers form random coils and beta-turns and fibrils and oligomeric fibrils form anti-parallel beta-sheets. The oligomers are inherently thermodynamically more stable than the dimers.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. SWI/SNF complexes containing DPF3 are specific to muscle cells where they play an essential role in the development of heart and skeletal muscle cells. Also found in brown adipocytes where they regulate gene-expression of brown fat-selective genes. Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1222) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) also may not co-occur. The following proteins may be associated with SWI/SNF (BAF) complex variants, with one or more from each family present in any given complex: DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785), BRD9 (Q9H8M2), SS18 (Q15532), BCL11A (Q9H165), BCL11B (Q9C0K0), BCL7A (Q4VC05), BCL7B (Q9BQE9), BCL7C (Q8WUZ0). Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as ARID1A, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1. SMARCE1 also has DNA binding-bending activity. DPF3 specifically binds acetylated histones 3 and 4: H3K14ac, H3K9ac, H4K5ac, h4K8ac, H4K12ac and H4K16ac.	-	-	Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) [Orphanet:1465]: a rare congenital multi-systemic genetic disorder characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth digit, developmental delay, intellectual disability, coarse facial features, and other variable clinical manifestations.|Intellectual disability-sparse hair-brachydactyly syndrome [Orphanet:3051]: a very rare condition of unknown etiology consisting of short stature, hypotrichosis, brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses, epilepsy and severe mental delay.

The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. The lack of subunit ARID1B suggests it primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor but also has the ability to activate some genes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. The embryonic stem cell-specific (esc-)SWI/SNF complex specifically lacks subunits ACTL6B (O94805), ARID1B (Q8NFD5), SMARCA2 (P51531), SMARCC2 (Q8TAQ2) and SMARCD3 (Q6STE5). SMARCD2 (Q92925) may be present in esc-SWI/SNF complexes in which case it probably forms a variant, replacing SMARCD1. BCL7A, BCL7B and BCL7C have been shown to be part of the esc-SWI/SNF complex but may be mutually exclusive and therefore probably forms further variants. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa.

The neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of neural progenitor stem cells by selectively activating or repressing its target genes. In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A is replaced by ACTL6B (O94805) and PHF10 replaced by DPF1 (Q92782) or DPF3 (Q92784) in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. Although similar in function to the embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex the composition of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complexes is more similar to the standard SWI/SNF complexes. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1212) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) also may not co-occur. It is not clear yet if DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785) is a member of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neuron-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for the proliferation of post-mitotic neurons and regulates genes specific for dendritic growth by binding tightly with CREST (O75177). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A (O96019) is replaced by ACTL6B and PHF10 (Q8WUB8) replaced by DPF1 or DPF3 in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1216) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) as well as DPF1 and DPF3 also may not co-occur. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as ARID1A, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1. SMARCE1 also has DNA binding-bending activity. DPF3 specifically binds acetylated histones 3 and 4: H3K14ac, H3K9ac, H4K5ac, H4K8ac, H4K12ac and H4K16ac. 	-	-	Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) [Orphanet:1465]: a rare congenital multi-systemic genetic disorder characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth digit, developmental delay, intellectual disability, coarse facial features, and other variable clinical manifestations.|Intellectual disability-sparse hair-brachydactyly syndrome [Orphanet:3051]: a very rare condition of unknown etiology consisting of short stature, hypotrichosis, brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses, epilepsy and severe mental delay.

Regulates cell differentiation in several lineages, such as T cells and myocytes, and specific variants exist in embryonic stem cells (esBAF) and neuronal progenitor cells (npBAF). Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional activation is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1B subunit. Removes Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 & PRC2) resulting in promoter activation via deubiquitination of H2AK119 and demethylation of H3K27. Activates, among others, transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes, glucocorticoid receptor-dependent genes and genes activating the Notch-signalling pathway. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (CPX-1205) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (this complex) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) also may not co-occur.

Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as ARID1B, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1. SMARCE1 also has DNA binding-bending activity. 	-	-	Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) [Orphanet:1465]: a rare congenital multi-systemic genetic disorder characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth digit, developmental delay, intellectual disability, coarse facial features, and other variable clinical manifestations.|Intellectual disability-sparse hair-brachydactyly syndrome [Orphanet:3051]: a very rare condition of unknown etiology consisting of short stature, hypotrichosis, brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses, epilepsy and severe mental delay.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of neural progenitor stem cells by selectively activating or repressing its target genes. In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A is replaced by ACTL6B (O94805) and PHF10 replaced by DPF1 (Q92782) or DPF3 (Q92784) in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. Although similar in function to the embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex (CPX-1195) the composition of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complexes is more similar to the standard SWI/SNF complexes. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (CPX-1201) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (this complex) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) also may not co-occur. It is not clear yet if DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785) is a member of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neuron-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for the proliferation of post-mitotic neurons and regulates genes specific for dendritic growth by binding tightly with CREST (O75177). In this variant of the complex transcriptional activation is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1B subunit. Removes Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) resulting in promoter activation via deubiquitination of H2AK119 and demethylation of H3K27. Activates, among others, transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes, glucocorticoid receptor-dependent genes and genes activating the Notch-signalling pathway. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A (O96019) is replaced by ACTL6B and PHF10 (Q8WUB8) replaced by DPF1 or DPF3 in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1218) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) as well as DPF1 and DPF3 also may not co-occur.

MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as ARID1B, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1.

Removes Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 & PRC2) resulting in promoter activation via deubiquitination of H2AK119 and demethylation of H3K27. Activates, among others, transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes, glucocorticoid receptor-dependent genes and genes activating the Notch-signalling pathway.

May contain pBAF-specific subunit PBRM1 (BAF180, Q86U86). Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as ARID1B, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. SWI/SNF complexes containing DPF3 are specific to muscle cells where they play an essential role in the development of heart and skeletal muscle cells. Also found in brown adipocytes where they regulate gene-expression of brown fat-selective genes.

Remodels the mRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) from nuclear to cytoplasmic specificity. MIF4GD subunit interacts with EIF4G1 (Q04637) and EIF4G2 (P78344), components of eIF4F complex, the cytoplasmic cap-binding complex that binds the 5-prime histone mRNA cap. EIF4G1/2 binding facilitates the circularisation of hmRNA that is required for its translation. Acts exclusively during G1/S transition when histones are in greatest demand. Both, the complex and hmRNA are degraded at the end of S phase when Thr-61 and Thr-62 of SLBP are phosphorylated. Translation of histones during other cell phases cause defects and can be toxic to the cell. 	SLBP is probably bound to the stem-loop structure of histone mRNA (hmRNA) throughout its life cycle (via its RNA-binding domain (RBD), IPR029344). hmRNA binding requires SLBP phosphorylation, specifically on Thr-171, but maybe other sites, too. It is not clear if MIF4GD already binds SLIP1 during pre-mRNA processing or only once the mRNA is exported into the cytoplasm. SLBP binds MIF4GD via its translation activation region. MIF4GD is essential for translation initiation and dissociates from SLBP before mRNA degradation commences. The active complex is probably a dimer as SLBP phosphorylation is incompatible with its dimerisation in the heterotetramer. Inactive, unphosphorylated heterotetamers have been observed but are contrary to the hypothesis of sequential binding of SLBP followed by MIF4GD on hmRNA. Additionally, MIF4GD dimers have been observed and may be required for the mRNA circularisation by binding SLBP and EIF4G1/2 simultaneously via its respective SMB domains.

Its formation is triggered by the release of Cytochrome c (P99999) from the mitochondria in response to intrinsic cell death stimuli. When released, Cytochrome c binds to APAF1 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to trigger nucleotide exchange and stepwise assembly of a heptameric structure. Pro-Caspase-9 is then recruited to form a multimeric Apaf1-Cytochrome c - pro-Caspase-9 complex. Once recruited, pro-Caspase-9 undergoes auto-cleavage resulting in two subunits: p35 and a p10. This step leads to the formation of a proteolytically active Apoptosome.	The functional oligomerized apoptosome is a wheel-like structure that consists of a heptameric arrangement of APAF1 molecules. APAF1 consists of three fundamental units: a sensor for an apoptotic stimulus (WD40 repeats), an oligomerization unit (NB-ARC) and a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The formation of the apoptosome is dependent on cytochrome c and the nucleotide triphosphates ATP. TheWD40 domain of APAF1 interacts with cytochrome c. The NB-ARC region of APAF1 provides the scaffold of the oligomer, whereas the CARD domains are arranged in a ring-like manner (CARD disk) near the centre of the assembly, generating a platform competent of binding and activating Procaspase-9. The CARD disk in the fully active apoptosome is an arrangement with a final 4:3 or 4:4 APAF1-CARD/caspase-9-CARD complex.

Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. Activating platform for Caspase-1 (CPX-952) through proximity-induced self-cleavage in an ATP-dependent reaction. Activated Caspase-1 cleaves interleukins 1beta (IL1B, P01584) and IL18 (Q14116) releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes and is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves GSDMD (P57764). It belongs to the family of Inflammasomes that includes NLRP3 inflammasome (CPX-4141), NLRC4 inflammasome (CPX-4144), AIM2 inflammasome (CPX-4142) and Pyrin inflammasome (CPX-4143). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the NLRP1 gene are associated with vitiligo.	The NLRP1 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that typically comprises nucleator (NLRP1), adaptor (PYCARD/ASC), and effector (zymogen procaspase-1) subunits. NLRP1 belongs to the family of Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which constitutes 22 members in humans and 34 in mice. The FIIND (domain with function to find) region in NLRP1 is involved in homomerization and autocatalytic cleavage in this region occurs constitutively, prior to activation signals. Once cleaved, N- and C-terminal products remain associated. NLRP1 oligomerizes via its NACHT domain and binds the pyrin domain (PYD) of the subunit PYCARD (ASC) with its N-terminal PYD. In turn, PYCARD (ASC) links procaspase-1 to the complex via CARD-CARD interactions. The complex has a ring-like organization, with an outer diameter of 13 nm and an inner diameter of 4 nm, with density peaks arranged in two concentric rings. The complex is a multimeric structure and the most likely ratio of CASP1:NLRP1:PYCARD is 1:1:1 but 2:1:1 is also a possibility. This complex can be formed without the adapter protein PYCARD (ASC), with lower catalytic activity. In this case, the CARD domain of procaspase-1 binds the CARD domain of NLRP1. 	-	-	Vitiligo [EFO:0004208]: A disorder consisting of areas of macular depigmentation, commonly on extensor aspects of extremities, on the face or neck, and in skin folds.

Mediates bidirectional synaptic signalling and coupling of presynaptic, Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis (= neurotransmitter release) with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor recruitment. Acts as a molecular switch between excitatory and inhibitory synapses: this complex acts primarily, but not exclusively, on glutamatergic, excitatory synapses that mainly release neurotransmitters glutamate and aspartate.

Heterotetramer composed of 2 neuroligin and 2 neurexin subunits. Each neurexin monomer binds to opposite sites of the central neuroligin dimer in a Ca2+-dependent manner.

Neuroligin 4 (= neuroligin X) and neuroligin Y have only been characterised in human, with little information available for neuroligin Y. Neuroligin 1 contains 2 splice sites (SSA & SSB), neuroligins 2 & 3 contain 1 splice site (SSA) and neuroligin 4/X probably contains no splice site. Each neurexin gene produces from independent promoters a longer alpha- and a shorter beta neurexin isoform. Alpha-neurexins contain 5 splice sites (SS1-SS5) and beta-neurexins contain 2 splice sites (SS4 & SS5) which leads to almost 4000 potential neurexin variants alone. The most common variants affecting binding and function are restricted to the presence or absence of neuroligin SSB (restricted to neuroligin 1) and neurexin SS4. These combinations are curated in this resource. N-glycosylation of neuroligin SSB (mainly on Asn300 [count based on NLGN1+SSA+SSB]) reduces binding to beta-neurexin SS4 and abolishes binding to alpha-neurexin SS4 as the intermolecular interfaces are proximal to these respective splice insertions.

Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. NLRP3 activation is triggered by two sequential signals. The basal level of NLRP3 in macrophages is quite low. Before activation, NLRP3 needs to be “primed” by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of TLR signaling not only transcriptionally up-regulates NLRP3 expression, but also post-transcriptionally activates NLRP3 by phosphorylation and deubiquitination. The second step, defined as “activation,” can be induced by several potent stimuli such as pore-forming toxins, leading to the oligomerization of NLRP3 and the subsequent assembly of inflammasome. Activating platform for Caspase-1 (CPX-952) through proximity-induced self-cleavage in an ATP-dependent reaction. Activated Caspase-1 cleaves interleukins 1beta (IL1B, P01584) and IL18 (Q14116) releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes and is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves GSDMD (P57764). Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is also required for HMGB1 (P09429) secretion which stimulate inflammatory responses. It belongs to the family of Inflammasomes that includes NLRP1 inflammasome (CPX-4082), NLRC4 inflammasome (CPX-4144), AIM2 inflammasome (CPX-4142) and Pyrin inflammasome (CPX-4143). The expression of NLRP3 and PYCARD is up-regulated in adipocytes from obese patients. Elevation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity has been observed in myeloid cells of patients affected by type 2 diabetes. Moreover, animal models support a role of this complex in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, gout, Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and atherosclerosis. 	The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that typically comprises nucleator (NLRP3), adaptor (PYCARD/ASC), and effector (zymogen procaspase-1) subunits. NLRP3 oligomerizes via its NACHT domain and binds the pyrin domain (PYD) of the subunit PYCARD (ASC) with its PYD. This causes PYVARD (ASC) to convert to a prion-like form and generate long PYCARD (ASC) filaments (or specks) that are crucial to inflammasome activation. Pro-caspase-1 then interacts with PYCARD (ASC) through CARD-CARD interactions and forms its own prion-like filaments that branch off of the ASC filaments. The complex has a ring-like organization. 	-	-	Obesity [EFO:0001073]: A status with body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body.

In some cases the proteolytic action activates the substrate, for example, it cleaves CDK5R1/p35 (Q15078) into its p25 form that is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction and implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Finely-balanced calpain homeostasis is required as both over and under-activation causes disease. Calpain complexes recognise their substrates based on a short peptide sequence. Inhibited by the intrinsically-unstructured calpastatin (P20810) by its tight binding to the calpain catalytic subunit. 	Calpain (CAPN1/muCL) and its small regulatory subunit (CAPNS1/30K) bind via their respective 5th (of 5) EF-hand motifs. The N-terminus of CAPNS1 contains hydrophobic Gly-clusters, the Gly-rich domain. The catalytically-active cleft is rather deep and narrow which might explains calpain's preference for digesting inter-domain unstructured regions. It is formed by the two calpain protease core domains, PC1 and PC2, containing one Ca2+-binding sites per core. Calcium binding to several domains of both subunits releases the steric hindrance by allowing PC1 and PC2 to move closer to each other while the secondary structures remain essentially unchanged and may result in the dissociation of the small regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunits. Most other members of the calpain family of proteins do not require a regulatory subunit and are activated directly by calcium binding. 	-	Calcium ion (Ca2+, CHEBI:29108)	Muscular dystrophy [Orphanet:98473]: Muscular dystrophy (MD) refers to a group of more than 30 genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement.|Cataract [EFO:0001059]: Partial or complete opacity of the crystalline lens of one or both eyes that decreases visual acuity and eventually results in blindness.

Binds to a variety of membrane receptors, such as the extracellular domains of lipoprotein receptors VLDLR (P98155) and LRP8 (APOER2, Q14114), both in a calcium-dependent manner, to Cadherin-related neuronal receptors (CNRs) or to alpha3beta1 integrin (CPX-1797). Receptor binding induces phosphorylation cascades, usually initiated by the phosphorylation of intracellular receptor adaptor protein DAB1 (O75553) or kinase LIMK1 (P53667). Also modulates phosphorylation of TAU (P10636). Eventually, Reelin induces receptor clustering, particularly of VLDLR, and internalization of a Reelin-receptor complex results in Reelin degradation. Reeling-induced signaling affects the dynamics of the actin and microtubular cytoskeleton as well as membrane trafficking through the regulation of the activity of small GTPases. It affects polarization, differentiation, neuronal migration and layer formation in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus or the cerebellum of the embryonic brain as well as migration of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, where it seems to act as a barrier to neuronal migration. Also affects neuron growth, maturation, and synaptic activity in the postnatal and adult brain. Abnormal Reelin expression in the brain can cause a range of neurologically-abnormal symptoms, including tremors, ataxia, lissencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia and malformation of cellular layers throughout the brain and it is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and Alzheimer's disease. 	Each Reelin subunit is composed of a signal peptide, an F-spondin-like Reeler domain, a unique region named "H" that is subdivided in three subdomains termed X, Y and Z, eight Reelin-specific repeats (RR1-8), and a positively charged sequence at the C-terminus. APOER2 and VLDLR as well as the calcium ion(s) bind to the central Reelin-specific repeats. Two Reelin subunits that bind each other by way of a disulfide-bond at C2100 and several non-covalent bonds form the basic complex unit. Subsequently, several homodimers form oligomeric supercomplexes.

Within each RAD50 subunit the N-terminal Walker A and the C-terminal Walker B nucleotide binding motifs stably associate with one another to form a bipartite ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type ATPase domain that preferentially binds and partially unwinds two broken dsDNA termini. The two RAD50 subunits, tethering the broken dsDNA ends bind through the coordination of a unique zinc ion forming the 2xRAD50 homodimer.

Binding of osteoprotegerin to cytokine TNFSF11 prevents the cytokine from binding its receptor TNFRSF11A/RANK (Q9Y6Q6) and thus inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Bone homeostasis seems to depend on the local ratio between cytokine and decoy receptor. Osteoprotegerin may also play a role in preventing arterial calcification. Plays some as yet to-be-defined role in mammary gland physiology and hormone-driven epithelial proliferation during pregnancy and may act as a protective factor in bone microenvironment by preventing breast cancer-induced bone loss and reducing intra-osseous tumour growth. Also possible decoy receptor for pro-apoptotic cytokine TNFSF10/TRAIL (P50591) which competes with TNFSF11 and releases the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. In vitro, binding affinity is 500x higher for TNFSF11 than TNFSF10.

The NPC exclusively mediates all transport between cytoplasm and nucleus. A single NPC in a human cell can transport up to 80 MDa of material within 1 second. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP. 	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope. The central channel of the pore has a diameter of ~60 nm diameter. The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. There are a total of 32 repeating NUP107 subcomplexes (also known as Y subcomplex) consisting of 10 subunits, NUP37, NUP43, NUP85, NUP96, NUP107, NUP133, NUP160, SEC13, SEH1 and ELYS. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. NRs and CRs have an inner diameter of ~84 nm. The inner ring complex (IRC) consists of NUP35, NUP93, NUP155, NUP188 and NUP205. 32 repeated units are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion into two horizontally stacked rings on each side of the NPC, thereby forming a structure composed of four overlapping rings. The trimeric NUP54-NUP58-NUP62 complex is anchored to the IRC via NUP93. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than ~40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. NUP358/RBP2, subcomplex NUP62-NUP88-NUP214, AAAS, NUP98, NUP42/CG1, GLE1 and RAE1 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP50, NUP153 and TPR localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket. Nup98 and RAE1 may occur on the cytoplasmic and nuclear side while NUP62 may occur on the cytoplasmic side and the inner channel. Subcomplex NUP62-NUP88-NUP214 also binds the IRC. NDC1, NUP210 and POM121 are transmembrane NUPs while TMEM33 (P57088) is a putative transmembrane NUP.

The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel.	The human ribosome (80S) has a molecular weight of 4.3 MDa: the large subunit (60S) consists of 28S, 5S and 5.8S rRNAs and 47 ribonucleproteins (RPs), while the small subunit (40S) (CPX-5223) possesses a single 18S rRNA chain and 33 RPs. Unlike yeast, in which the majority of RPs have paralogs due to genome duplications, only six of RPs have paralogs in humans. Some RP paralogs are shown to have different tissue specificity and, as in the case of RPL3/RPL3L and RPL22/RPL22L1, to be mutual exclusive. Ribosome heterogeneity is not unique to the protein components of the ribosome: it can also occur at the level of rRNA. The rRNAs are encoded by multiple copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) on different chromosomes. Distinct rRNA usage has been suggested to correlate with different developmental stages. A distinct lateral protuberance called the stalk is located on the large ribosomal subunit and plays a central role in the ribosome-mediated stimulation of translation factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis. The 5 acidic ribosomal P-proteins form the pentameric stalk. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P05386(0)|P05387(0)|P05388(0)|P18077(0)|P18124(0)|P18621(0)|P26373(0)|P30050(0)|P32969(0)|P36578(0)|P40429(0)|P42766(0)|P46776(0)|P46777(0)|P46778(0)|P46779(0)|P47914(0)|P49207(0)|P50914(0)|P61313(0)|P61353(0)|P61513(0)|P61927(0)|P62424(0)|P62750(0)|P62829(0)|P62888(0)|P62899(0)|P62906(0)|P62910(0)|P62913(0)|P62917(0)|P62945(0)|P62987(0)|P63173(0)|P83731(0)|P84098(0)|Q02543(0)|Q02878(0)|Q07020(0)|Q9Y3U8(0)|[P39023,Q92901](0)|[Q6P5R6,P35268](0)|[Q969Q0,P83881](0)|[Q96EH5,P62891](0)|[Q96L21,P27635](0)|[Q9UNX3,P61254](0)

The mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) is responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins, including at least some of the essential transmembrane subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. All proteins synthesized by human mitoribosomes are hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins and some require prosthetic groups for folding and functioning. The mitoribosomes are tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane and translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane. The inner membrane protein MRPL45 aligns the mitochondrial peptide exit tunnel with the membrane insertion machinery and supports the transfer of the mitochondrial nascent peptides towards the membrane. The mt-SSU binds mRNA, is involved in accurate initiation and decoding, and undergoes large-scale conformational changes during the elongation cycle. Mutations in mitochondrial ribosome subunits have been found associated to cardiomyopathies, developmental abnormalities, cancer and hearing loss (ototoxicity).	The mitoribosome has a sedimentation coefficient of 55S and consists of a large 39S (LSU) (CPX-5226) and small 28S subunit (SSU). These subunits contain a 16S rRNA and 12S rRNA respectively, and no 5S rRNA. They differ from cytoplasmic and bacterial ribosomes in having a high protein to RNA ratio: 80 proteins, of which 36 are specific to mitochondria.

The mitoribosomes are tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane and translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane. The inner membrane protein MRPL45 aligns the mitochondrial peptide exit tunnel with the membrane insertion machinery and supports the transfer of the mitochondrial nascent peptides towards the membrane. Mutations in mitochondrial ribosome subunits have been found associated to cardiomyopathies, developmental abnormalities, cancer and hearing loss (ototoxicity).	The mitoribosome has a sedimentation coefficient of 55S and consists of a large 39S (LSU) and small 28S subunit (SSU)(CPX-5225). These subunits contain a 16S rRNA and 12S rRNA respectively, and no 5S rRNA. They differ from cytoplasmic and bacterial ribosomes in having a high protein to RNA ratio: 80 proteins, of which 36 are specific to mitochondria. Unlike their cytoplasmic counterparts, human mitoribosomes are permanently tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane through the LSU. A distinct lateral protuberance called the stalk is located on the large ribosomal subuniit and plays a central role in the ribosome-mediated stimulation of translation factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis. 	-	-	cardiomyopathy [EFO:0000318]: A disease of the heart muscle or myocardium proper. Cardiomyopathies may be classified as either primary or secondary, on the basis of etiology, or on the pathophysiology of the lesion: hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive.|cancer [EFO:0000311]: A tumor composed of atypical neoplastic, often pleomorphic cells that invade other tissues. Malignant neoplasms often metastasize to distant anatomic sites and may recur after excision. The most common malignant neoplasms are carcinomas (adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, leukemias, melanomas, and sarcomas.|ototoxicity [EFO:0006951]: damage to the ear, specifically the cochlea or auditory nerve as a result of some toxic stimulus, eg from a drug.

The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXRA) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Like other NRs, RXRA contains DNA-binding and ligand-binding domain (DBD, LBD). In the absence of agonist, the complex recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription. Upon ligand binding, RXRs undergo a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors and transcriptional coactivators, such as NCOA1, are recruited to the LBD which activates transcription. 	Coactivator NCOA1 contains an LXXLL motif (where X is any amino acid) which forms strong ligand-dependent interactions with members of the retinoic acid receptor superfamily of proteins. Unusually for class II nuclear receptors, RXRA also forms transcriptionally active homodimers (CPX-664) although their physiological significance is not clear.

C3(H2O)Bb convertase is very unstable and readily inactivated by Factor H (P08603) thus regulating the amount of spontaneously available C3 convertase initiating the alternative pathway.

Energy stress manifests as a drop in the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to AMP/ADP, which activates AMPK's kinase activity, allowing it to upregulate ATP-generating catabolic pathways and to reduce energy-consuming catabolic pathways and cellular programs: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation. AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators.	Heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic alpha-subunit (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2), a scaffolding beta-subunit (PRKAB1 or PRKAB2) and a regulatory gamma-subunit (PRKAG1, PRKAG2 or PRKAG3) subunits. The beta scaffolding subunit mediates AMPK assembly by bridging alpha and gamma subunits. Alterations in AMP/ATP ratio are sensed by the gamma subunit through four cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) motifs forming three AMP binding sites, two of which are exchangeable with ATP. The alpha catalytic subunit contains an N-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain (KD), a putative autoinhibitory domain (AID) and a C-terminal region required for beta subunit binding. AMPK is activated (approximately 1000-fold) via phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in the activation loop of the KD by upstream protein kinases. Binding of AMP to the non-catalytic gamma subunit results in allosteric activation, inducing phosphorylation on Thr-183 of the alpha subunit.

Heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic alpha-subunit (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2), a scaffolding beta-subunit (PRKAB1 or PRKAB2) and a regulatory gamma-subunit (PRKAG1, PRKAG2 or PRKAG3) subunits. The beta scaffolding subunit mediates AMPK assembly by bridging alpha and gamma subunits. Alterations in AMP/ATP ratio are sensed by the gamma subunit through four cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) motifs forming three AMP binding sites, two of which are exchangeable with ATP. The alpha catalytic subunit contains an N-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain (KD), a putative autoinhibitory domain (AID) and a C-terminal region required for beta subunit binding. AMPK is activated (approximately 1000-fold) via phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in the activation loop of the KD by upstream protein kinases. Binding of AMP to the non-catalytic gamma subunit results in allosteric activation, inducing phosphorylation on Thr-172 of the alpha subunit.

Energy stress manifests as a drop in the ratio of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to AMP/ADP, which activates AMPK's kinase activity, allowing it to upregulate ATP-generating catabolic pathways and to reduce energy-consuming catabolic pathways and cellular programs: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation.

Alterations in AMP/ATP ratio are sensed by the gamma subunit through four cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) motifs forming three AMP binding sites, two of which are exchangeable with ATP.

Before the commencement of replication, the cohesin complex is loaded onto DNA. The arms of the SMC1/3 molecules embrace the DNA, thereby forming a ring of approx. 40 nm diameter. The homologous ATPases SMC1 and SMC3 heterodimerize through their hinge domains with their head domains locked together by RAD21. Cohesion might be generated as the replication fork passes through the ring, entrapping both sister chromatids inside. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, RAD21 is cleaved by separase, thereby opening the lock of the SMC1/3 head domains. The ring opens and sister chromatids can be pulled to opposite spindle poles. RAD21 is required to efficiently recruit meiotic axis proteins and evenly distribute these along the meiotic chromosomes.

Before the commencement of replication, the cohesin complex is loaded onto DNA. The arms of the SMC1/3 molecules embrace the DNA, thereby forming a ring of approx. 40 nm diameter. The homologous ATPases SMC1 and SMC3 heterodimerize through their hinge domains with their head domains locked together by RAD21. Cohesion might be generated as the replication fork passes through the ring, entrapping both sister chromatids inside. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, RAD21 is cleaved by separase, thereby opening the lock of the SMC1/3 head domains. The ring opens and sister chromatids can be pulled to opposite spindle poles. RAD21 is required to efficiently recruit meiotic axis proteins and evenly distribute these along the meiotic chromosomes. STAGs bind RAD21 and provide docking sites for other regulators.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O60216(0)|Q14683(0)|Q8N3U4(0)|Q9UQE7(0)

Proteins targeted for degradation are covalently labeled with polyubiquitin chains which are recognized and removed by the proteasome. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. The regulatory particles act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. The base drives the mechanical substrate unfolding and translocation of the unstructured polypeptides into the degradation chamber of the core peptidase. The lid contains the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) PSMD14 that cleaves polyubiquitin chains from targeted substrates as an essential step in proteasomal substrate processing.	The 26S proteasome consists of one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles (RPs). The 20S proteasome core is composed of 28 subunits that are arranged in four stacked rings, resulting in a barrel-shaped structure. The two outer rings of the core are each formed by seven alpha subunits, and the two central rings are each formed by seven beta subunits. The RP is divided into the lid and base assembly intermediates. The lid comprises nine PSMD subunits (PSMD3/6/7/8/11/12/13/14/SEM1) and the base comprises three PSMD subunits (PSMD1/2/ADRM1) and six AAA+ ATPases (PSMC1-6) which form a heterohexameric ring. PSMD4, which consists of an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A domain and multiple C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM), connects the lid and the base.

The synthesis of ATP is coupled to the respiratory chain via the proton potential. The ATP synthase is a molecular motor composed of two separable parts: F1 and Fo. The F1 portion contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis and protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix. Fo forms a proton turbine that is embedded in the inner membrane and connected to the rotor of F1. The flux of protons flowing down a potential gradient powers the rotation of the rotor driving the synthesis of ATP. Thus, the flow of protons though Fo is coupled to the synthesis of ATP. 	Multimeric enzyme complex with an overall molecular weight of about 600,000 Da, consisting of an extra-membranous F1 catalytic domain linked by a central stalk to an intrinsic Fo membrane domain. ATP5F1A and ATP5F1B subunits (the stator) are arranged alternately around a coiled coil of two anti-parallel alpha helices in the ATP5F1C subunit. The catalytic sites are in the ATP5F1B subunits at the ATP5F1A/B subunit interface. The proton pore of the ATP synthase consists of a ring of membrane-integrated c subunits (ATP5F1G1/2/3), which rotates, driven by downhill proton diffusion across the membrane. An essential carboxylate side chain in each subunit provides a proton-binding site. The entire central rotor shaft, made of the c-ring and ATP5F1C/D/E subunits, rotates and induces cyclic conformational changes in the ATP5F1A/B-heterohexamer necessary for the synthesis of ATP. To prevent dragged rotation, the peripheral stator stalk, consisting of ATP5PO/OSCP, /ATP5PFF6,ATP5PB/b- and ATP5PD/d-subunits, connects the stator casing in F1 and that in Fo (a-subunit).	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0486"(UniProt)	O75947(0)|O75964(0)|P00846(0)|P03928(0)|P05496(0)|P06576(3)|P18859(0)|P24539(0)|P25705(3)|P30049(1)|P36542(1)|P48047(0)|P48201(0)|P56134(0)|P56378(0)|P56381(1)|P56385(0)|Q06055(0)|Q5VTU8(0)|Q7Z4Y8(0)|Q96IX5(0)

From cryo-EM experiments it has been estimated that 18-22 C9 chains oligomerize to give rise to a large beta-barrel that forms a 110 A diameter pore in target membranes. 	-	-	Age-related macular degeneration [EFO:0001365]: age-related loss of vision in the central portion of the retina (macula), secondary to retinal degeneration.|Complement deficiency [MONDO:0003832]: a genetic deficiency of any of the component of the complement system (including the classical, alternative, and terminal pathway components), that can either be acquired or inherited.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P01031-PRO_0000005985(1)|P01031-PRO_0000005989(1)|P02748(18)|P07357(1)|P07358(1)|P07360(1)|P10643(1)|P13671(1)

Activates the LP by binding sugar moieties of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) displayed on microbes via the lectin MBL2 subcomplex. Binds preferentially to mannose, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine. Also binds to late, but not early, apoptotic cells, as well as to apoptotic blebs and to necrotic cells facilitating their uptake by macrophages. MASP2 protease is activated by cleavage by a MASP1 from a neighbouring MBL2-MASP1 complex (CPX-6170) and in turn cleaves and activates complement precursors C4 (P0C0L4) and C2 (P06681) to form C3 convertase complexes C4b2a-A (CPX-5675) and C4b2a-B (CPX-6156). 	Three identical, collagen-like coiled-coil helices of MBL2 form stable trimers that associate in their N-terminal half to form a stalk and terminate in a C-terminal globular domain. These trimers further oligomerize through their N‐terminal regions. Tetramers of trimers appear to be the most stable configuration but trimers and pentamers of MBL2 trimers also bind MASPs. The collagen‐like triple helix domain provides the interaction site for MASPs. MASP1 protruding from MBL2-MASP1 complex (CPX-6170) binds and activates MSAP2 protease in this complex possibly forming a larger complex. MASP2 is activated by proteolytic cleavage into a heavy and light chain which remain bound to each other within the larger complex. MAp19 (sMAP) is an isoform of MASP2 (O00187-2) and may act as an accessory protein of this complex.

Fibrin clot (CPX-6230) formation is catalysed by factor XIIIa (CPX-6231). Clots are dissolved mainly by the proteolytic action of plasmin (P00747). 	Formed from two alpha-beta-gamma fibrinogen heterotrimers that are linked to each other by 29 disulfide bonds in a molecule with bilateral symmetry. The 2 heterotrimers are in a head to head conformation with the N-termini in a small central domain. Alpha-thrombin removes small peptides from the amino termini of the alpha and beta chains, exposing sets of "knobs" that interact noncovalently with ever-present "holes" on neighbouring molecules to form oligomers termed protofibrils. As polymerization progresses, factor XIIIa incorporates covalent cross-links, initially between the carboxy-terminal segments of gamma chains, but eventually also including alpha chains.

Fibrinogen heterohexamers (CPX-1922) are activated by minor proteolysis of alpha and beta chains by alpha-thrombin complex (CPX-6222) to form so-called fibrin monomers (CPX-6225). Fibrin clot (this complex) formation is catalysed by factor XIIIa (CPX-6231). Clots are dissolved mainly by the proteolytic action of plasmin (P00747). 	The basic unit of a fibrin clot is formed from two alpha-beta-gamma fibrinogen heterotrimers that are linked to each other by 29 disulfide bonds in a molecule with bilateral symmetry. The 2 heterotrimers are in a head to head conformation with the N-termini in a small central domain. Alpha-thrombin removes small peptides from the amino termini of the alpha and beta chains, exposing sets of "knobs" that interact noncovalently with ever-present "holes" on neighbouring molecules to form oligomers termed protofibrils. As polymerization progresses, factor XIIIa (CPX-6231) incorporates covalent cross-links, initially between the carboxy-terminal segments of gamma chains, but eventually also including alpha chains.

This provides a metabolic connection between glycolysis, whose end product is pyruvate, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which starts with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is negatively regulated via phosphorylation of its PDHA1 subunit. In the reaction mediated by the PDH complex, pyruvate becomes covalently linked to the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor of E1 (PDHA1 and PDHB), creating 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP. The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (DLAT). DLAT transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA.	Pyruvate dehydrogenase consists of five subunits that are assembled into a large heteromultimer of 8-9 megadaltons. The core is comprised of 40 copies of DLAT (also known as E2; dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase) and 20 copies of PDHX E3-binding protein that form a pentagonal dodecahedron. Twenty copies of DLD dimers (also known as E3; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) are attached to the DLAT core via the binding protein PDHX. A variable number, approximately 40 PDHA1 and PDHB (also known as E1 alpha and E1 beta, respectively) heterotetramers bind to the DLAT core. 	-	-	Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDH) [Orphanet:765]: an enzymatic defect causing primary lactic acidosis in children.

This provides a metabolic connection between glycolysis, whose end product is pyruvate, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which starts with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is negatively regulated via phosphorylation of its PDHA2 subunit. In the reaction mediated by the PDH complex, pyruvate becomes covalently linked to the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor of E1 (PDHA2 and PDHB), creating 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP. The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (DLAT). DLAT transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA.	Pyruvate dehydrogenase consists of five subunits that are assembled into a large heteromultimer of 8-9 megadaltons. The core is comprised of 40 copies of DLAT (also known as E2; dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase) and 20 copies of PDHX E3-binding protein that form a pentagonal dodecahedron. Twenty copies of DLD dimers (also known as E3; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) are attached to the DLAT core via the binding protein PDHX. A variable number, approximately 40 PDHA2 and PDHB (also known as E1 alpha and E1 beta, respectively) heterotetramers bind to the DLAT core. 	-	-	Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDH) [Orphanet:765]: an enzymatic defect causing primary lactic acidosis in children.

ICL repair is activated when a replication fork stalls at an ICL, triggering monoubiquitination of the complex by the Fanconi Anemia ubiquitin ligase (CPX-6263), with one ubiquitin molecule being conjugated to each protein subunit. This may convert the ID complex into a clamp that can slide away from its initial location, potentially enabling downstream nucleases and other factors to act on the ICL.	In the non-ubiquitinated ID complex, FANCI and FANCD2 interact along the length of their N-terminal solenoids in an antiparallel direction, forming an extended interface.

Required for promoter-proximal pausing when elongating Pol II pauses near the promoter, about 20-60 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site, a key event in post-initiation regulation of transcription. SUPT5H (O00267) docks the DSIF complex (CPX-891) to Pol II near the RNA exit channel where it facilitates capping of the nascent RNA. NELF then recognizes the Pol II-SUPT5H interface and associates with the elongation complex as it transcribes through the promoter-proximal region. Binding of newly synthesized RNA by NELF may stabilize its interactions with elongating Pol II at specific loci. Phosphorylation of SUPT5H by P-TEFb (CPX-222/CPX-321/CPX-322) appears to trigger dissociation of NELF from Pol II, enabling Pol II reactivation and resumption of elongation.

Required for genome-wide de novo methylation, a major epigenetic mechanism that controls gene expression, genomic stability, and cell differentiation. Predominantly occurs at the C-5 position of cytosine within the symmetric CpG dinucleotide, affecting approximately 70-80% of the CpG sites throughout the genome. Also responsible fornon-CpG methylation (mainly CpA ) in oocytes, embryonic stem cells, and neural cells DNA. the DNMT3B–3L complex plays a role in early embryonic development and in minor satellite repeat methylation. Methylates pericentric satellite repeats and actively transcribed genes within the gene body to prevent spurious transcription initiation.	The DNMT3B–3L complex binds and encloses DNA via the catalytic and target recognition domains. The CpG site is clamped by the two loops from two different sides of the DNA molecule, with the catalytic loop bound in the minor groove and the target recognition domain loop being bound in the major groove. The cytosine of CpG sites is flipped out of the DNA and is inserts deeply into the catalytic pocket of DNMT3B. DNMT3L allosterically stimulates catalytic activity.	Heterotetramer	-	Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 2 (FSHD2): A degenerative muscle disease characterized by slowly progressive weakness of the muscles of the face, upper-arm, and shoulder girdle. The onset of symptoms usually occurs in the first or second decade of life. Affected individuals usually present with impairment of upper extremity elevation. This tends to be followed by facial weakness, primarily involving the orbicularis oris and orbicularis oculi muscles. DNMT3B mutations lead to DUX4 expression in somatic tissues, including muscle cells, when an haplotype on chromosome 4 is permissive for DUX4 expression. Ectopic expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle activates the expression of stem cell and germline genes, and, when overexpressed in somatic cells, DUX4 can ultimately lead to cell death.|Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies syndrome 1 (ICF1): A rare disorder characterized by a variable immunodeficiency resulting in recurrent infections, facial anomalies, and branching of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16. Other variable symptoms include growth retardation, failure to thrive, and psychomotor retardation. Laboratory studies show limited hypomethylation of DNA in a small fraction of the genome in some, but not all, patients.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(ceitec)	Q9UBC3(0)|Q9UJW3(0)

Acts as the decoding centre of the ribosome which brings mRNA and aminoacylated transfer (t)RNAs together, with the 16S ribosomal (r)RNA being required for the selection of the cognate tRNA.	The human ribosome (80S) has a molecular weight of 4.3 MDa: the large subunit (60S) (CPX-5183) consists of 28S, 5S and 5.8S rRNAs and 47 ribonucleproteins (RPs), while the small subunit (40S) possesses a single 18S rRNA chain and 33 RPs. Unlike yeast, in which the majority of RPs have paralogs due to genome duplications, only two of RPs have paralogs in humans. Some RP paralogs are shown to have different tissue specificity and, as in some case, to be mutual exclusive. Ribosome heterogeneity is not unique to the protein components of the ribosome: it can also occur at the level of rRNA. The rRNAs are encoded by multiple copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) on different chromosomes. Distinct rRNA usage has been suggested to correlate with different developmental stages. The core of the 40S subunit is formed by the 18S ribosomal RNA, whilst the ribosomal proteins create binding sites for the mRNA and the tRNA A-site, P-site and E-site. Whilst there is normally considered to be a single copy of each polymer in the mature ribosome, there is evidence that the composition can vary in response to physiological conditions, potentially altering the translational efficiency of distinct mRNAs.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P08708(0)|P08865(0)|P15880(0)|P23396(0)|P25398(0)|P39019(0)|P46781(0)|P46782(0)|P46783(0)|P60866(0)|P61247(0)|P62081(0)|P62241(0)|P62244(0)|P62249(0)|P62263(0)|P62266(0)|P62269(0)|P62273(0)|P62277(0)|P62280(0)|P62753(0)|P62841(0)|P62847(0)|P62851(0)|P62854(0)|P62857(0)|P62861(0)|P62979(0)|P63220(0)|P63244(0)|[P62701](0)|[Q71UM5,P42677](0)

The central helices of the two RFX5 molecules form an anti-parallel coiled coil, and the flanking helices pack at the ends of the long helices in a perpendicular arrangement .The C-terminus of RFXAP consists of two alpha-helices that form a V-shaped structure that packs between the RFX5 dimeric central helices. Three hydrophobic pockets formed by the ankyrin domains of RFXANK are occupied by Met-172, Leu-175, and Leu-178 of RFX5. Complex formation is required for DNA binding.

GET1 and CAMLG (GET2) act as a membrane receptor for soluble GET3, which recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol, delivered to it by the BAT3 transmembrane domain recognition complex (CPX-132). 	In the cytoplasm, the TA protein interacts with the closed ADP-bound form of the GET3 dimer, which encloses the substrate transmembrane domain within a hydrophobic groove. GET3 then first binds to the flexible cytoplasmic domain of CAMLG from a pair of GET1/CAMLG heterodimers, and subsequently to the GET1-cytoplasmic domains which drives the formation of a GET1/CAMLG membrane heterotetramer stabilized by phosphatidylinositol binding at the heterotetramer interface. Binding to GET1/CAMLG stabilizes the open form of the GET3 dimer, leading to nucleotide release and disruption of the substrate binding site. A short CAMLG cytoplasmic alpha helix guides the substrate transmembrane domain towards the bilayer, interactions between the substrate C-terminus and the hydrophilic groove of GET1 then enables insertion into the membrane.

Recognises peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) that are displayed by antigen presenting cells, a prerequisite for efficient T cell adaptive immunity against pathogens. Each TCR possesses unique antigen specificity, determined by the antigen binding site created by the variable regions of the alpha and beta subunits (TRAC, TRBC2). Binding of alpha-beta subunits to the antigen bound to MHC initiates TCR clustering on the cell surface. Downstream signalling is activate by LCK (P06239) which phosphorylates the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of subunits CD3G, CD3D, CD3E and CD247. As antigens only bind to the extracellular domains of the alpha and beta subunits and they do not possess ITAMs the TCR-pMHC-binding information is probably relayed via the ITAMs of the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits. 	The alpha and beta subunits both contain extracellular constant and variable domains; the variable domains, with three hypervariable regions, are omitted from this entry as they are unique to each T cell. While all subunits have a single transmembrane domain and protrude into both the extracellular and cytoplasmic space, TRAC and TRBC1 contain very short cytoplasmic tails and CD247 a very short extracellular domain. The complex consists of 4 internal dimers: TCRalpha-beta (TRAC-TRBC2), CD3delta-epsilon (CD3D-CD3E), CD3gamma-epsilon (CD3G-CD3E) and the CD3zeta homodimer (CD247). The overall structure of the TCR-CD3 complex is shaped like an ice cream cone with an extracellular portion protruding from the plasma membrane. The TCR constant alpha and beta domains and the extracellular domains of CD3gamma-epsilon and CD3delta-epsilon are arranged with an approximate three-fold symmetry, constituting the middle section of the complex. The TCR alpha and beta variable domains protrude out of the plane defined by this middle section and are positioned most distal to the plasma membrane. The transmembrane segment of the complex contains eight helices, which form a helix-bundle-like structure with the two transmembrane helices of TCR alpha and beta at the centre.

Recognises peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) that are displayed by antigen presenting cells, a prerequisite for efficient T cell adaptive immunity against pathogens. Each TCR possesses unique antigen specificity, determined by the antigen binding site created by the variable regions of the alpha and beta subunits (TRAC, TRBC1). Binding of alpha-beta subunits to the antigen bound to MHC initiates TCR clustering on the cell surface. Downstream signalling is activate by LCK (P06239) which phosphorylates the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of subunits CD3G, CD3D, CD3E and CD247. As antigens only bind to the extracellular domains of the alpha and beta subunits and they do not possess ITAMs the TCR-pMHC-binding information is probably relayed via the ITAMs of the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits. 	The alpha and beta subunits both contain extracellular constant and variable domains; the variable domains, with three hypervariable regions, are omitted from this entry as they are unique to each T cell. While all subunits have a single transmembrane domain and protrude into both the extracellular and cytoplasmic space, TRAC and TRBC1 contain very short cytoplasmic tails and CD247 a very short extracellular domain. The complex consists of 4 internal dimers: TCRalpha-beta (TRAC-TRBC1), CD3delta-epsilon (CD3D-CD3E), CD3gamma-epsilon (CD3G-CD3E) and the CD3zeta homodimer (CD247). The overall structure of the TCR-CD3 complex is shaped like an ice cream cone with an extracellular portion protruding from the plasma membrane. The TCR constant alpha and beta domains and the extracellular domains of CD3 gamma-epsilon and CD3delta-epsilon are arranged with an approximate three-fold symmetry, constituting the middle section of the complex. The TCR alpha and beta variable domains protrude out of the plane defined by this middle section and are positioned most distal to the plasma membrane. The transmembrane segment of the complex contains eight helices, which form a helix-bundle-like structure with the two transmembrane helices of TCR alpha and beta at the centre.

While alpha-beta TCR (CPX-6482, CPX-6581) expressing T cells are more commonly found in peripheral blood, gamma-delta TCR-expressing T cells constitute the major subset of resident T cells in tissues bordering the external environment such as the dermis, the intestine, the lung and the uterus. Gamma-delta TCRs do not absolutely require classic antigen priming and clonal expansion in the thymus and appear to recognise microorganism-derived proteins and self-proteins (such as heat-shock proteins) without a requirement for antigen pre-processing or major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) presentation of peptide epitopes. Some gamma-delta T-cell receptors recognise MHC class Ib molecules or structurally diverse and biologically unrelated compounds such as lipopeptides on cell surfaces. Activated cells produce cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17) and chemokines (RANTES, IP-10, lymphotactin), contributing to a rapid, innate-like immune response to a broad spectrum of pathogens during the initiation phase of the immune response. This rapid response bridges the transition from the innate to adaptive immune response. Each TCR possesses unique antigen specificity, determined by the antigen binding site created by the variable regions of the gamma and delta subunits (TRGC1, TRDC). Downstream signalling is activate by LCK (P06239) and FYN (P06241) kinases which phosphorylate the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of subunits CD3G, CD3E and CD247. As antigens only bind to the extracellular domains of the gamma and delta subunits and they do not possess ITAMs, information is probably relayed via the ITAMs of the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits. Gamma-delta TCRs appear to be more efficient in signalling than alpha-beta TCRs. This rapid and un-primed response by T cells expressing gamma-delta TCRs and IL-17 can also induce inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity (in particular psoriasis), and metastasis. 	The gamma and delta subunits both contain extracellular constant and variable domains; the variable domains, with three hypervariable regions, are omitted from this entry as they are unique to each T cell. While all subunits have a single transmembrane domain and protrude into both the extracellular and cytoplasmic space, TRGC1 and TRDC contain very short cytoplasmic tails and CD247 a very short extracellular domain.

Gamma-delta TCR-expressing T cells also contain a very small amount of gamma-delta TCRs with one CD3delta-epsilon (CD3D-CD3E) and one CD3gamma-epsilon (CD3G-CD3E) heterodimer, akin to the alpha-beta TCRs (CPX-6482, CPX-6581).

While alpha-beta TCR (CPX-6482, CPX-6581) expressing T cells are more commonly found in peripheral blood, gamma-delta TCR-expressing T cells constitute the major subset of resident T cells in tissues bordering the external environment such as the dermis, the intestine, the lung and the uterus. Gamma-delta TCRs do not absolutely require classic antigen priming and clonal expansion in the thymus and appear to recognise microorganism-derived proteins and self-proteins (such as heat-shock proteins) without a requirement for antigen pre-processing or major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) presentation of peptide epitopes. Some gamma-delta T-cell receptors recognise MHC class Ib molecules or structurally diverse and biologically unrelated compounds such as lipopeptides on cell surfaces. Activated cells produce cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17) and chemokines (RANTES, IP-10, lymphotactin), contributing to a rapid, innate-like immune response to a broad spectrum of pathogens during the initiation phase of the immune response. This rapid response bridges the transition from the innate to adaptive immune response. Each TCR possesses unique antigen specificity, determined by the antigen binding site created by the variable regions of the gamma and delta subunits (TRGC2, TRDC). Downstream signalling is activate by LCK (P06239) and FYN (P06241) kinases which phosphorylate the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of subunits CD3G, CD3E and CD247. As antigens only bind to the extracellular domains of the gamma and delta subunits and they do not possess ITAMs, information is probably relayed via the ITAMs of the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits. Gamma-delta TCRs appear to be more efficient in signalling than alpha-beta TCRs. This rapid and un-primed response by T cells expressing gamma-delta TCRs and IL-17 can also induce inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity (in particular psoriasis), and metastasis. 	The gamma and delta subunits both contain extracellular constant and variable domains; the variable domains, with three hypervariable regions, are omitted from this entry as they are unique to each T cell. While all subunits have a single transmembrane domain and protrude into both the extracellular and cytoplasmic space, TRGC1 and TRDC contain very short cytoplasmic tails and CD247 a very short extracellular domain. The complex consists of 4 internal dimers: a TCRgamma-delta (TRGC2-TRDC) heterodimer, two CD3gamma-epsilon (CD3G-CD3E) heterodimers and a CD3zeta homodimer (CD247). Gamma-delta TCR-expressing T cells also contain a very small amount of gamma-delta TCRs with one CD3delta-epsilon (CD3D-CD3E) and one CD3gamma-epsilon (CD3G-CD3E) heterodimer, akin to the alpha-beta TCRs (CPX-6482, CPX-6581).

In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies) mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens. IgD is the major antigen receptor isotype on the surface of most peripheral B-cells, where it is coexpressed with IgM. IgM and IgD molecules present on B cells have identical V regions and antigen-binding sites. 	Immunoglobulins consist of two heavy (H) and two light (L) chain subunits. All subunits both contain extracellular constant and variable domains; the variable domains are omitted from this entry as they are unique to each B cell. The antigen binding site is formed by three regions of sequence variability (the complementarity determining regions, or CDRs) of one heavy chain pairing with the three CDRs of its associated light chain. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a specific antigen. 	Heterotetramer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P01834(2)|P01880(2)

The enzyme transfers an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-1-phosphate residue to a terminal mannose on high mannose-type N-linked glycans of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes using UDP-GlcNAc (CHEBI:57705) as donor. 	The alpha- and beta-subunits are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as a common 190-kDa type III precursor membrane protein that assembles with soluble gaama-subunits. Following signal-dependent transport of the inactive complex to the Golgi apparatus, MBTPS1 (Q14703) catalyzes the cleavage of the alpha/beta-subunit precursor protein, resulting in enzymatic activation of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. The gamma-subunit enhances the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity for M6P modification of specific lysosomal enzymes.

Cognitive function is normal or only slightly impaired and retinitis pigmentosa has been reported in a few patients. Many survive into early adulthood, but ultimately succumb to cardiorespiratory insufficiency.

The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The ATP6V0A2 variant localizes to the Golgi apparatus.	The V-ATPase complex can be functionally separated into two subcomplexes: the V1 domain is a 600-650 kDa peripheral complex involved directly in ATP hydrolysis and the integral membrane V0 domain responsible for the translocation of protons across a membrane bilayer. The membrane-embedded V0 domain is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of components a, c, c'', d, e, f, ATP6AP1/Ac45 and ATP6AP2/PRR (ATP6V0A1/ATP6V0A2/ATP6V0A3/ATP6V0A14, ATP6V0C, ATP6V0B, ATP6V0D1/ATP6V0D2, ATP6V0E1/ATP6V0E2, RNASEK, ATP6AP, ATP6AP2).

Sequential ATP hydrolysis by the AB subunits produces conformational changes in the A3B3 hexamer that induce rotation of the central stalk (DFd) and the c-ring. The c, and c'' subunits that form the c-ring have conserved glutamate residues on their outer alpha-helices that are required for proton translocation. For every three ATP hydrolysis events, there is one complete rotation of the central stalk and c-ring.

The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The ATP6V0A3 variant localizes to endolysosomal compartments and can also be trafficked to the plasma membrane, being found at the ruffled border of osteoclasts.	The V-ATPase complex can be functionally separated into two subcomplexes: the V1 domain is a 600-650 kDa peripheral complex involved directly in ATP hydrolysis and the integral membrane V0 domain responsible for the translocation of protons across a membrane bilayer. The membrane-embedded V0 domain is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of components a, c, c'', d, e, f, ATP6AP1/Ac45 and ATP6AP2/PRR (ATP6V0A1/ATP6V0A2/ATP6V0A3/ATP6V0A14, ATP6V0C, ATP6V0B, ATP6V0D1/ATP6V0D2, ATP6V0E1/ATP6V0E2, RNASEK, ATP6AP, ATP6AP2). The soluble V1 domain contains subunits A-H (ATP6V1A, ATP6V1B1, ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1C1, ATP6V1C2, ATP6V1D, ATP6V1E1, ATP6V1E2, ATP6V1E3, ATP6V1F, ATP6V1G1, ATP6V1G2, ATP6V1AG3, ATP6V1H) and consists of three catalytic AB heterodimers that form a heterohexamer, three peripheral stalks each consisting of EG heterodimers, one central rotor including subunits D and F, and the regulatory subunits C and H. Sequential ATP hydrolysis by the AB subunits produces conformational changes in the A3B3 hexamer that induce rotation of the central stalk (DFd) and the c-ring. The c, and c'' subunits that form the c-ring have conserved glutamate residues on their outer alpha-helices that are required for proton translocation. For every three ATP hydrolysis events, there is one complete rotation of the central stalk and c-ring.

The DNA recognition sequence depends on the composition of the bZIP dimer with the complex either binding to the preferred region of one of the partners or to a novel bZIP cognate site. Acts as a transcriptional repressor binding to the MARE (Maf recognition element) site in gene promoters, thus repressing the expression of NFE2L2 (Q16236) target genes which play a key role in the response to oxidative stress. Represses the transcription of heme oxygenase 1 (P09601) under low heme conditions. When free heme levels rise, activated NFE2L2 partners with MAF proteins to enable transactivation of HMOX1. Heme binds to BACH1 and heme-bound BACH1 undergoes nuclear export and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. 	Dimerization is mediated by the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) 60-80 amino acid domain, consisting of a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The latter domain adopts an alpha helical structure where leucine, or leucine-like, side chains line up on the same side of the helix and interact with the alpha helix of the leucine zipper of the other family member to enable dimer formation. DNA binding specificity appears to be linked to low-affinity binding sites which guide transcription factors to their cognate target sites.

Plays a key role in inflammatory response through the activation of NF-kappa-B and inflammsone activation, protection from programmed cell death and autophagy.	 MW of approximately 600 kDa suggests a heteromultimeric assembly of its subunits. RNF31 transfers ubiquitin from the E2 carrying ubiquitin at its RING1 zinc-finger domain to a specific Cys residue (Cys-885) in the RING2 zinc-finger atypical domain. It then catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin on Cys-885 and the alpha-amino group of the acceptor ubiquitin, which is recognized by its linear ubiquitin chain-determining domain (IPR041031). Binding of SHARPIN or RBCK1 to RNF31 drives conformational changes in the UBA domain (IPR015940) of RNF31, which in turn allosterically re-arranges the relative orientation between UBA and the linear ubiquitin chain-determining domain, thereby facilitating the E2 loading of this domain and enhancing the catalytic activity of the complex.

The BBSome complex is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor (P61006/Q92930), which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. RAB8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/RABIN8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for RAB8 and then the RAB8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex, together with the LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog pathway regulation.	The apparent molecular weight of the BBSome (438 kDa) calculated from its measured Stokes radius (78 A) and sedimentation coefficient (14 S) is in close agreement with its predicted molecular weight of 470 kDa.	-	-	Ciliopathy [EFO:0003900]: Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad spectrum of disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies.

The ciliopathy range of diseases includes Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, nephronophtisis, Senior-Loken syndrome, and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy among others. Single-locus allelism is insufficient to explain the variable penetrance and expressivity of such disorders, leading to the suggestion that variations across multiple sites of the ciliary proteome, including BBS1, influence the clinical outcome.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	A8MTZ0(0)|Q3SYG4(0)|Q8IWZ6(0)|Q8N3I7(0)|Q8NFJ9(0)|Q8TAM2(0)|Q96RK4(0)|Q9BXC9(0)

Fibrinogen heterohexamers (this complex) are activated by minor proteolysis of alpha and beta chains by alpha-thrombin complex (CPX-6222) to form so-called fibrin monomers (CPX-6225). Fibrin clot (CPX-6230) formation is catalysed by factor XIIIa (CPX-6231). Clots are dissolved mainly by the proteolytic action of plasmin (P00747). 	Two alpha-beta-gamma fibrinogen heterotrimers are linked to each other by 29 disulfide bonds in a molecule with bilateral symmetry. The 2 heterotrimers are in a head to head conformation with the N-termini in a small central domain. Alpha-thrombin removes small peptides from the amino termini of the alpha and beta chains, exposing sets of "knobs" that interact noncovalently with ever-present "holes" on neighbouring molecules to form oligomers termed protofibrils. As polymerization progresses, factor XIIIa (CPX-6231) incorporates covalent cross-links, initially between the carboxy-terminal segments of gamma chains, but eventually also including alpha chains.

Deposited by spliceosomes at a conserved position of a pre-messenger RNA strand located upstream of exon junctions formed during RNA splicing. The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle is exported to the cytoplasm, potentially promoting export through its close association with the TREX complex. Binds RNA primarily through EIF4A3, a sequence-independent DEAD box protein that grasps RNA stably only when associated with its partners, RBM8A/Y14 and MAGOH which inhibit the DEAD-box protein EIF4A3 ATPase activity, trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The EJC core serves as a binding platform for additional factors which together then interface with numerous machineries controlling mRNA export, translation, and decay. Discriminates between premature and normal translation termination events by providing architectural information regarding the position of (former) introns. When translation terminates on an mRNA upstream of at least one EJC, UPF3 (Q9H1J1/Q9BZI7) and its cofactors UPF1 (Q9H1J1) and UPF2 (Q9HAU5) orchestrate a series of events that destabilize the message by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Also enhances translation of newly synthesized mRNAs through interactions between POLDIP3 (Q9BY77) and activated S6-kinase.	The EJC structure resembles an L-shaped molecule structurally divided into two binary complexes EIF4A3-Btz at the base of the assembly and MAGOH-Y14 arranged almost perpendicularly to it. The alpha-helical surface of MAGOH interacts with the beta-sheet surface of the RNA binding domain of Y14. The domain organization of EIF4A3 is typical of the DEAD-box family of proteins, with two RecA-like domains that are arranged to form a deep interdomain cleft where ATP binds. Single-stranded RNA binds with an overall bent conformation in a shallow cleft across the two RecA-like domains and is flanked on one side by Btz. Btz extends with two separate stretches over both domains of eIF4A3 and also contacts MAGOH. The MAGOH-Y14 heterodimer interacts mainly with domain 2 of EIF4A3 but also docks into the interdomain cleft.

Binding of the EJC key regulator PYM1 (Q9BRP8) to MAGOH-Y14 in the cytoplasm triggers disassembly of the EJC. MAGOH-Y14 complex remains bound in the same position on the spliced mRNA and requires translation of the mRNA for removal. When interacting with PYM1, associates with mRNA-degradation factors, including the mRNA-decapping complex and exoribonucleases and may play a role in preventing mRNA degradation during mRNA biogenesis. This complex itself does not bind RNA. Binding to IPO13 (O94829) leads to import back into the nucleus prior to reassembly of the EJC.	The conserved RNA binding surface of Y14 is entirely occluded by the helical face of Magoh in the complex.

Three main types of BT have been described (minor, intermedia [Orphanet:231222] and major [Orphanet:231214]). 1) Thalassemia minor (BT-minor, BT trait) is the heterozygous form and is usually asymptomatic. 2) Thalassemia major (Cooley anemia; BT-major) is the homozygous form and associates splenomegaly and microcytic and hypochromic anemia resulting from dyserythropoiesis and hemolysis. Onset generally occurs from 6-24 months of age. Patients require regular transfusions. 3) Thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in which the anemia is less severe and diagnosed later in life compared to BT-major. Patients with BTI may or may not require occasional transfusions. Rare autosomal dominant forms have also been described (dominant beta-thalassemia [Orphanet:231226]) resulting in moderate to severe anemia. Transmission is autosomal recessive and around 200 mutations (B0 or B+) have been identified.|Sickle cell anemia [Orphanet:232]: a chronic hemolytic diseases that may induce three types of acute accidents: severe anemia, severe bacterial infections, and ischemic vasoocclusive accidents (VOA) caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells obstructing small blood vessels and capillaries. The presence of fetal hemoglobin means that the disease doesn't manifest until after 3 months. In addition to anemia and bacterial infections, VOAs cause hyperalgic focal ischemia (and sometimes infarction) when they occur in the muscles or skeleton. Over the course of time, VOAs may compromise the integrity of tissues or organs. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Sickle cell anemia is determined by combinations of two abnormal alleles of the beta globin gene among which at least one carries the beta 6 glu-val mutation (Hb S). Sickle cell anemia reduces the susceptibility to malaria infection.|Alpha-thalassemia [Orphanet:846]: Alpha-thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by impaired synthesis of alpha-globin chains leading to a variable clinical picture depending on the number of affected alleles. The disease can be classified into clinical subtypes of increasing severity: silent alpha thalassemia, alpha thalassemia trait (or alpha thalassemia minor), hemoglobin H disease (HbH, [Orphanet:93616]), and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis [Orphanet:163596]. A rare form called alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome linked to chromosome 16 (16p13.3) has also been identified. Alpha thalassemia trait causes microcytosis and hypochromia with absent or mild anemia (often detected on routine blood tests), generally with no other symptoms. HbH patients develop moderate hemolytic anemia with variable amounts of HbH along with occasionally severe splenomegaly, sometimes complicated by hypersplenism. Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis involves a severe deficiency in alpha-globin with serious developmental implications. Alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome is characterized by very mild to severe anemia associated with developmental abnormalities.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P68871(2)|P69905(2)

Upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example TNF-alpha. Mediates fast, short-lived synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters and is more active than the alpha9 homopentamer (CPX-226). Mainly found in peripheral nervous system and non-neuronal cells, especially in the auditory system (mechanosensory hair, inner-ear tissue, the cochlea) but also in tonsils, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and PBMCs, keratinocytes and in the pituitary gland. In the auditory system the subunits assemble to form the receptor that mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear cholinergic fibers which descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the cochlea.	Pentamer with probable stoichiometry of 2:3 or 3:2. The alpha subunit always supplies the ‘plus’-side of the ligand binding interface and determines ligand affinity whilst any subunit can supply the ‘minus’-binding side which determines ligand selectivity. At least two ligand binding sides are present. Each subunit has four transmembrane domains and the transmembrane domains 2 line the channel influencing channel conductance and ion selectivity. Signal sequences guide cotranslational assembly in the ER membrane. Palmitoylation of cysteine residues during assembly influence cell-specific expression on the plasma membrane. N-linked, NH2-terminal glycosylation is required for insertion into the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic loop regulates assembly, expression and function. MW ~290 kD for pentamer.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains. In the 5-HT3A/B heteromer, the 5-HT3A shields the ER-retention signal of the 5-HT3B subunit allowing export of the heteromeric complex from the ER to the plasma membrane.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P46098(5)

Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits causing swelling or stiffening of endothelia and which can ultimately lead to hypertension. 	The stoichiometry is uncertain and could be heterotrimeric, heterohexameric, heterononameric with equal ratios for the three subunits or heterotetrameric with alpha-beta-gamma ratio of 2:1:1.

Constitutive activation of the epithelial sodium channel can also be caused by high dietary salt intake or excessive licorice consumption.|Hypertension [EFO:0000537]: persistently high systemic arterial blood pressure. Based on multiple readings, hypertension is currently defined as when systolic pressure is consistently greater than 140 mm Hg or when diastolic pressure is consistently 90 mm Hg or more. Loss of epithelial sodium channel self-inhibition activity under high sodium conditions leads to salt-sensitive hypertension [MP:0004217]: sustained high blood pressure that is maintained with the amount of salt consumed in the diet; blood pressure may return to normotensive with a low salt diet.|Cystic fibrosis (CF) [Orphanet:586]: an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity due to airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration. As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections. SPLUNC1 negatively regulates ENaC activity and therefore maintains normal ASL homeostasis. Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	-	amiloride (CHEBI:2639)|zinc ion (Zn2+, CHEBI:29105)	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P37088(0)|P51168(0)|P51170(0)

Replacement of one or more subunits with GluN3A (Q8TCU5) or GluN3B (O60391) subunits results in relatively Ca2+-impermeable cation channels that are resistant to Mg2+. Dysfunctional NMDA receptors are implicated in various neurological disorders and injuries including depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, chronic and neuropathic pain, as well as neuronal loss following ischaemia or stroke.	Obligate heterotetramer formed around a central pore, with distinct domains that are arranged in parallel for all subunits. Topology of the N1/N2 units probably of 1-2-1-2 arrangement but some experiments suggest 1-1-2-2 arrangement. The GluN1 subunits occupy a proximal position, closer to the central axis of the channel pore than that of GluN2/N3 subunits. GluN1 and GluN3 bind allosteric activators glycine or D-serine and GluN2 binds allosteric activators L-glutamate or NMDA at the extracellular ligand-binding domain formed by the N1-N2/N3 heterodimers. NMDA mimicks the action of glutamate, specifically binds to GluN2 subunits and regulates the NMDA-type iGlu receptors only. Polyamines act as allosteric modulators by binding to the extracellular n-terminal domain (NTD). Zn2+ acts as an allosteric inhibitor by binding to the bilobed cleft of the NTD. H+ also acts as an allosteric inhibitor but its binding site remains uncertain. Mg2+ binds the "GluN2 S/L site" of the transmembrane domain.

The complex is organized around a probable 24-mer transacylase (E2, DBT) core, to which multiple (approximately 6-12) copies of a heterotetrameric decarboxylase (E1, BCKDHA/BCKDHB) and approximately 6 copies of the dimeric dehydrogenase (E3, DLD) are attached through noncovalent interactions. The lipoyl-bearing domain (LBD) of the E2 core imparts substrate channeling by sequentially visiting different active sites in each of the three E1, E2, and E3 catalytic components, leading to the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids. The E1 component is a thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes both the ThDP-dependent decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids to produce the alpha-carbanion-ThDP intermediate and the reductive acylation of oxidized lipoylated LBD on E2, forming S-acyldihydrolipoamide. 	-	-	Maple syrup urine disease [Orphanet:511]: an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, DBT, and DLD genes leading to enzyme defects in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Accumulation of these 3 amino acids and their corresponding keto acids leads to encephalopathy and progressive neurodegeneration. Clinical features include mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odour to the urine which give the disease its name. The keto acids of the branched-chain amino acids are present in the urine. If untreated, maple syrup urine disease can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The disease is often classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms. The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Variant forms of the disorder become apparent later in infancy or childhood and are typically milder, but they still involve developmental delay and other medical problems if not treated.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P09622(12)|P11182(24)|P12694(12)|P21953(12)

As the17S snRNP enters the spliceosome, SF3b6 recognizes the branch site adenosine in pre-mRNA and facilitates an interaction between U2 and the branch point sequence. Once catalytic activation of the spliceosome is primed, the SF3B complex is removed from the branch point through the action of the ATPase DHX16 (O60231) but still binds loosely to U2 within the spliceosome until it finally disassembles from the splicing machinery.

Final assembly and peptide binding take place within the peptide-loading complex (PLC), where the heterodimers undergo peptide editing. The complex seems to be required for the inhibition of the reduction of the disulfide bonds of the heavy chains and the assembly and stabilization of the PLC, suggesting PDIA3/ERp57 may play a structural role rather than a catalytic one.	PDIA3 contains four thioredoxin-like domains.

There is a covalent bond between Cys-115 in this loop and Cys-57 in the PDIA3 catalytic motif. The fourth domain of PDIA3 (residues 406-409) forms an interface in the Ig-like portion of the TAPBP N-terminus. Thus, in the crystal structure both PDIA3 active sites are engaged in contacts with TAPBP and inaccessible to the MHC class I molecule and may not exhibit redox activity.

The spliceosome is a highly dynamic structure, assembled by sequential binding and release of the small nuclear RNAs and protein factors which removes intronic sequence from pre-mRNA. The DEAD-box helicase DDX23 releases the 5' splice site from U1 snRNP and transfers it to the ACAGAGA box within U6 snRNA. The RNA helicase SNRNP200 then separates U4 snRNA from U6 snRNA and allows the U6 snRNA sequence adjacent to the 5' splice site-bound ACAGAGA box to fold and associate with part of U2 snRNA to yield the active site harboring two catalytic metal ions. When the branch site adenosine is docked into the active site, the branching reaction produces the cleaved 5' exon and the lariat-intron intermediate. The 5' exon remains in the active site, but the branch site adenosine must leave the active site for the incoming 3′ splice site site for the exon–ligation reaction. Finally, the 5' and 3' exons are ligated, and the resulting mRNA is released from the active site. 	Two heteroheptameric rings of Sm proteins bind to the U4 and U5 snRNAs’ 3'-terminal Sm sites, the LSm ring binds to the 3' end of U6 snRNA. The U4 and U6 snRNAs are base-paired, forming a three-way junction with U4 acting as a chaperone to keep U6 in a precatalytic conformation. During activation, the U4/U6 duplex is disrupted and a highly structured RNA interaction network forms among the U2, U6, and U5 snRNAs and the pre-mRNA, generating the spliceosome’s catalytic RNA core. The major scaffolding protein PRPF8 interacts with SNRNP200 and EFTUD2 and all reactive sites of the intron (5' and 3' splice sites and the branch site) at the spliceosome’s catalytic core.. SNRNP200 unwinds the U4/U6 snRNA helices and is the major driving force for catalytic activation.

In skeletal muscle, it limits mechanical damage during contraction and thus prevents muscle degeneration. The complex also functions as a scaffold for proteins involved in signaling such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1, P29475).	In skeletal muscle, the N-terminal actin-binding domain and specific spectrin repeats in the central rod of dystrophin bind to costamere F-actin. The cysteine-rich region and the C terminus of dystrophin establish the link with the DGC through binding to DAG1 beta chain and DTNA (Q9Y4J8-3), respectively.

Membrane-bound ion transporters/proton exchangers use the pH gradient to sequester metal ions to the vacuole and other cellular organelles. The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The ATP6V0A1 variant localizes to synaptic vesicles in presynaptic neurons and to late endo/lysosomal compartments in non-neuronal tissues.	The V-ATPase complex can be functionally separated into two subcomplexes: the V1 domain is a 600-650 kDa peripheral complex involved directly in ATP hydrolysis and the integral membrane V0 domain responsible for the translocation of protons across a membrane bilayer. The membrane-embedded V0 domain is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of components a, c, c'', d, e, f, ATP6AP1/Ac45 and ATP6AP2/PRR (ATP6V0A1/ATP6V0A2/ATP6V0A3/ATP6V0A14, ATP6V0C, ATP6V0B, ATP6V0D1/ATP6V0D2, ATP6V0E1/ATP6V0E2, RNASEK, ATP6AP, ATP6AP2). The soluble V1 domain contains subunits A-H (ATP6V1A, ATP6V1B1, ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1C1, ATP6V1C2, ATP6V1D, ATP6V1E1, ATP6V1E2, ATP6V1E3, ATP6V1F, ATP6V1G1, ATP6V1G2, ATP6V1AG3, ATP6V1H) and consists of three catalytic AB heterodimers that form a heterohexamer, three peripheral stalks each consisting of EG heterodimers, one central rotor including subunits D and F, and the regulatory subunits C and H. Sequential ATP hydrolysis by the AB subunits produces conformational changes in the A3B3 hexamer that induce rotation of the central stalk (DFd) and the c-ring. The c, and c'' subunits that form the c-ring have conserved glutamate residues on their outer alpha-helices that are required for proton translocation. For every three ATP hydrolysis events, there is one complete rotation of the central stalk and c-ring.

Also acts to chaperone the nascent mRNA by inhibiting the formation of harmful DNA-RNA hybrids, (R-loops), thus protecting genome integrity. The THO subcomplex is recruited to the mRNP and delivers DDX39B, which clamps the mRNA. THO-DDX39B binds export adapters such as ALYREF and together they promote loading of NXF1-NXT onto mRNA.. It is predicted that the multiple variants of this complex may exist with different compositional rearrangements of its adapter subunits.	A seven-subunit core complex (THOC1-2, 5-7, DDX39B) multimerizes into a 28-subunit tetrameric assembly, suggesting that selective recognition of mature mRNA is facilitated by the simultaneous sensing of multiple, spatially distant mRNA regions and maturation markers. The tetramer consists of two asymmetric dimers, each comprising two seven-subunit core monomers. Two DDX39B RNA helicases are juxtaposed at each end of the tetramer, which allows one bivalent accessory protein such as ALYREF to bridge adjacent helicases and regulate the TREX-mRNA interaction. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O75152(0)|P82979(0)|P84090(0)|Q13769(0)|Q13838(0)|Q53F19(0)|Q6I9Y2(0)|Q86V81(0)|Q86W42(0)|Q8NI27(0)|Q96FV9(0)|Q96J01(0)|Q96QD9(0)|Q9BY77(0)|Q9P127(0)|Q9Y3Y2(0)

U2 snRNP binds to the intron branch site of the commitment complex to form the pre-spliceosome in an ATP dependent step. Stably interacts with the pre-RNA intron branch site (BS), forming the spliceosomal A complex in which U2 snRNA base pairs with the BS, causing the branch site adenosine to bulge out from the U2/BS helix. The U2-BS interaction is reinforced by the U2AF65/35 heterodimer (CPX-1921), which binds the intron pyrimidine-rich region, and by the U2-associated, heteromeric protein complexes SF3A (CPX-2565) and SF3B (CPX-2227) that contact the intron 6 to 26 nucleotides upstream of the BS-A (anchoring site) Prior to the first catalytic reaction, SF3A and SF3B dissociate from the spliceosome, presumably making the branch site accessible to lariat formation. The spliceosome is a highly dynamic structure, assembled by sequential binding and release of the small nuclear RNAs and protein factors which removes intronic sequence from pre-mRNA.

In some cases the proteolytic action activates the substrate, for example, it cleaves CDK5R1/p35 (Q15078) into its p25 form that is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction and implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Finely-balanced calpain homeostasis is required as both over and under-activation causes disease. Calpain complexes recognise their substrates based on a short peptide sequence. Inhibited by the intrinsically-unstructured calpastatin (P20810) by its tight binding to the calpain catalytic subunit. 	Calpain (CAPN2/mCL) and its small regulatory subunit (CAPNS1/30K) bind via their respective 5th (of 5) EF-hand motifs. The N-terminus of CAPNS1 contains hydrophobic Gly-clusters, the Gly-rich domain. The catalytically-active cleft is rather deep and narrow which might explains calpain's preference for digesting inter-domain unstructured regions. It is formed by the two calpain protease core domains, PC1 and PC2, containing one Ca2+-binding sites per core. Calcium binding to several domains of both subunits releases the steric hindrance by allowing PC1 and PC2 to move closer to each other while the secondary structures remain essentially unchanged and may result in the dissociation of the small regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunits. Most other members of the calpain family of proteins do not require a regulatory subunit and are activated directly by calcium binding. 	-	Calcium ion (Ca2+, CHEBI:29108)	Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 76 [EFO:0009019]: Spastic paraplegia-76 is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by young-adult onset of slowly progressive spasticity of the lower limbs resulting in gait difficulties.

The resulting 43S complex, which also includes eIF3 (CPX-6036) and eIF1A, binds at or near the 5'-end of capped eukaryotic messenger RNAs. Recognition of the AUG codon translational start site is accompanied by GTP hydrolysis (stimulated by the eIF5 complex), which releases Met-tRNA to the ribosomal peptidyl site and converts eIF2-GTP to eIF2-GDP. Binding of nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B complex (CPX-429) replaces GDP again for GTP. This activity is inhibited when phosphorylated eIF2 (alpha subunit) binds to eIF2B. 	-	-	-	MEHMO syndrome is characterised by severe intellectual deficit, epilepsy, microcephaly, hypogenitalism, and obesity.

BACH1 can bind heme, causing it to be released from DNA and undergo nuclear export for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thus releasing transcription suppression of the BACH1 target gene, heme oxygenase 1.(P09601).	Dimerization is mediated by the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) 60-80 amino acid domain, consisting of a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The latter domain adopts an alpha helical structure where leucine, or leucine-like, side chains line up on the same side of the helix and interact with the alpha helix of the leucine zipper of the other family member to enable dimer formation. DNA binding specificity appears to be linked to low-affinity binding sites which guide transcription factors to their cognate target sites.	Homodimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O14867(2)

The two subunits ETFA (alpha) and ETFB (beta) of the complex form three separate domains: domain I, consisting of the N-terminal portion of the alpha subunit; domain II, the C-terminal portion of the alpha subunit and a small C-terminal portion of the beta subunit; and domain III, composed of the majority of the beta subunit. Tight interactions between domains I and III stabilize the quarternary structure of the ETF complex, while forming a shallow bowl where domain II rests. FAD is bound in a cleft between domains II and III, while domain III binds the AMP molecule. This may be the vestigial remnant of a second binding site for FAD or NADP.

Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 binds to and clusters ubiquitinated cargo for delivery into MVBs, and recruits clathrin, ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitinating enzymes. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission. Disassembly of ESCRT-III by VPS4A/B may be a required step for fission.	-	Heterodimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O14964(1)|Q92783(1)

When active, SMG1 mediates phosphorylation of the RNA helicase UPF1 (Q92900), a key player in the nonsense-mediated decay pathway.	The C-terminal kinase inhibitory domain of SMG8 inhibits the kinase activity of SMG1 by covering the catalytic pocket and sterically hindering substrate entry. It has been proposed that ATP binding triggers the SMG1 kinase to adopt an autoinhibited conformation mediated by the concerted action of the SMG1 insertion domain (2427–3606) in cis and the SMG8 C-terminus in trans. The presence of the correct substrate and possibly other factors/cues trigger the release of the autoinhibition and activity of the kinase toward UPF1.

The DNA recognition sequence depends on the composition of the bZIP dimer with the complex either binding to the preferred region of one of the partners or to a novel bZIP cognate site. Acts as a transcriptional repressor binding to the MARE (Maf recognition element) site in gene promoters, thus repressing the expression of NFE2L2 (Q16236) target genes which play a key role in the response to oxidative stress. Represses the transcription of heme oxygenase 1 (P09601) under low heme conditions. When free heme levels rise, activated NFE2L2 partners with MAF proteins to enable transactivation of HMOX1. Heme binds to BACH1 and heme-bound BACH1 undergoes nuclear export and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. 	Dimerization is mediated by the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) 60-80 amino acid domain, consisting of a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The latter domain adopts an alpha helical structure where leucine, or leucine-like, side chains line up on the same side of the helix and interact with the alpha helix of the leucine zipper of the other family member to enable dimer formation. DNA binding specificity appears to be linked to low-affinity binding sites which guide transcription factors to their cognate target sites.

Three main types of BT have been described (minor, intermedia [Orphanet:231222] and major [Orphanet:231214]). 1) Thalassemia minor (BT-minor, BT trait) is the heterozygous form and is usually asymptomatic. 2) Thalassemia major (Cooley anemia; BT-major) is the homozygous form and associates splenomegaly and microcytic and hypochromic anemia resulting from dyserythropoiesis and hemolysis. Onset generally occurs from 6-24 months of age. Patients require regular transfusions. 3) Thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in which the anemia is less severe and diagnosed later in life compared to BT-major. Patients with BTI may or may not require occasional transfusions. Rare autosomal dominant forms have also been described (dominant beta-thalassemia [Orphanet:231226]) resulting in moderate to severe anemia.

The presence of fetal hemoglobin means that the disease doesn't manifest until after 3 months. In addition to anemia and bacterial infections, VOAs cause hyperalgic focal ischemia (and sometimes infarction) when they occur in the muscles or skeleton. Over the course of time, VOAs may compromise the integrity of tissues or organs. Transmission is autosomal recessive.

In addition to anemia and bacterial infections, VOAs cause hyperalgic focal ischemia (and sometimes infarction) when they occur in the muscles or skeleton.

Three main types of BT have been described (minor, intermedia [Orphanet:231222] and major [Orphanet:231214]). 1) Thalassemia minor (BT-minor, BT trait) is the heterozygous form and is usually asymptomatic. 2) Thalassemia major (Cooley anemia; BT-major) is the homozygous form and associates splenomegaly and microcytic and hypochromic anemia resulting from dyserythropoiesis and hemolysis. Onset generally occurs from 6-24 months of age. Patients require regular transfusions. 3) Thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in which the anemia is less severe and diagnosed later in life compared to BT-major. Patients with BTI may or may not require occasional transfusions. Rare autosomal dominant forms have also been described (dominant beta-thalassemia [Orphanet:231226]) resulting in moderate to severe anemia.

Linked via G-proteins to potassium channels. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase, stimulates phospholipase A2, activates potassium channels, inactivates voltage-dependent calcium-channels and modulates inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Calcium is required for high affinity binding to GABA. Plays a critical role in the fine-tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Pre-synaptic GABA receptor inhibits neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, whereas postsynaptic GABA receptor decreases neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Not only implicated in synaptic inhibition but also in hippocampal long-term potentiation, slow wave sleep, muscle relaxation and antinociception.	In the apo state and antagonist-bound state the two subunits only bind via their respective LB1 domains keeping the dimer in the open, inactive conformation. Antagonists bind almost exclusively to the LB1 domain of the GABBR1 subunit. In contrast, agonist binding occurs between the LB1 and LB2 domains of the GABBR1 subunit. It induces large conformational changes in the dimer resulting in domain closure of the ligand binding site of GABBR1 and inter-subunit binding via both, the LB1 and LB2 domains of either subunit. GABBR1 residues Trp65 and His170 are indispensible for ligand binding while Tyr250 and Trp278 are critical for agonist binding only. GABBR2 mediates coupling to G proteins probably via the linker region between the transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) and the transmembrane domain 4 (TM4). Homodimers of either subunit may form, but are inactive.

Regulates gene expression and cell proliferation by binding transcription factors such as Histone pThr12-H3, Oct-4 (Q01860), Stat3 (P40763), pTyr333-β-catenin (P35222). Often, but not always, phosphorylates the transcription factor using beta-d-fructofuranose 1,6-bisphosphate (CHEBI:28013) as phosphate donor. Nuclear translocation is induced by PIAS3-mediated sumoylation and ERK2-mediated phosphorylation on Ser-37. Redirects glucose-derived carbons towards biosynthesis, indirectly supporting the Warburg effect, by regulating gene expression in the nucleus. This switch is tightly controlled by oncogenes, tumor suppressors and growth signals and affected by post-translational modifications of PKM2. Important allosteric affectors for the dimeric state are human papilloma virus E7, promyelocytic leukemia (PML, P29590), EGFR-mediated-pY46-MUC1-C (P15941), phosphor-tyrosine proteins and SAICAR (succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose-50-phosphate).

The Kir2.1 channel is characterized by a strong inward rectification, in which K+ ions flow preferentially into rather than out of the cell. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. Inward rectification is produced by cytosolic polyamines and Mg2+ occluding the ion conductance pathway as K+ ions are flowing outward. These positively charged particles are then removed from the pore when K+ ions flow into the cell. Rectification is the primary means of gating for Kir2 channels. In addition to rectification, another common feature of Kir channels is regulation by the membrane phospholipid PIP2. Opening of Kir channels requires PIP2 binding to basic and polar amino acids in the cytoplasmic domains, whereas depletion of PIP2 seems to close the channel. Expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle.	In addition to the homotetramer, KCNJ2 can form heterotetramers with other members of the Kir2 protein family.

Mutations in three different genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and KCNJ2, all encoding cardiac ionic potassium channels have been identified in affected patients. Transmission is autosomal dominant. Expression studies have shown a gain of function and a shortening of the action potential duration, explaining the short QT interval.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	Q12809(4)|Q9Y6J6(4)

Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR1 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the muscle fibers. Implicated in skeletal muscle development, ossification, dermatogenesis and cardiovascular development. Expressed in the brain, where it can mediate the NO-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in neurons. The E-C coupling involves the mechanical interaction between RyR1 in the SR and DHPR (also known as L-type Ca2+ channel, CPX-3192) in the T-tubule. There is some evidence to suggest that this happens through the direct physical interaction of the two channels. FKBP12 binds and co-purifies with RyR1, but the intrinsic isomerase activity is not essential for RyR effects. FKBP is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. RyR1 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR1, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR1, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. S100A1 binds speciﬁcally to the puriﬁed RyR1 in a Ca2+ dependent manner, at regions overlapping with CaM binding sites, and enhances the open probability of RyR1 reconstituted in lipid bilayers. TRDN, ASPH, CACNA1S, Homer-1 and ATP stimulates RyR1 channel activity. Calmodulin with bound calcium inhibits the RYR1 channel activity, as is binding to magnesium ions (Mg+2).	The functional form of the Ryr1 calcium channel is a 30 S homotetramer of negatively charged and cooperatively coupled subunits of high molecular weight. There is in vitro evidence for homodimer and homotrimer formation, but no evidence for functional relevance of these complexes. MW (tetramer) = 2.2MDa The calcium release channel activity resides in the C-terminal region while the remaining part of the protein constitutes the foot structure spanning the junctional gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the T-tubule. The basic architecture can be described as a mushroom, with a large cup representing ~80% of the volume located in the cytoplasm and the stalk crossing the membrane into the SR/ER lumen. The large cytoplasmic domain is the site of interactions with a large number of the modulators of channel activity. Specifically, the corners of the cytoplasmic area, also called clamps, are the sites of interactions with modulators. RyRs are arrayed in the SR and the clamps are likely to participate in intermolecular interactions with neighbouring RyRs. The large cytoplasmic domain is also the site of mutations that underlie the RyR channelopathies.

Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR2 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the cardiac muscle fibers. The E-C coupling in cardiac muscle involves RyR2 calcium release triggered by Ca2+ influx due to activation of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 (CPX-3195). RyR2 is required for heart development. Aberrant channel activation can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. RyR2 is also shown to play a role in beta cell survival in vitro. RyR2 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR2, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR2, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. PKA binds to RyR2 altering the gating. S100A1 binding enhances the open probability of RyR2. ASPH and ATP stimulates RyR2 channel activity. Magnesium ions (Mg+2) inhibits the RyR2 channel activity. Homer-1c binding inhibits RyR2 channel opening. Calmodulin binding may inhibit open basal probability and alter the Ca-dependent activation of RyR2. FKBP binding is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. Binding to sorcin decreases open channel probability. CaMKIId binds and phosphorylates RyR2 strongly activating Ca2+ release during both diastole and systole.	The functional form of the Ryr2 calcium channel is a 30 S homotetramer of negatively charged and cooperatively coupled subunits of high molecular weight. MW (tetramer) > 2MDa The calcium release channel activity resides in the C-terminal region while the remaining part of the protein constitutes the foot structure spanning the junctional gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the T-tubule. The basic architecture can be described as a mushroom, with a large cup representing ~80% of the volume located in the cytoplasm and the stalk crossing the membrane into the SR/ER lumen. The large cytoplasmic domain is the site of interactions with a large number of the modulators of channel activity. Specifically, the corners of the cytoplasmic area, also called clamps, are the sites of interactions with modulators. RyRs are arrayed in the SR and the clamps are likely to participate in intermolecular interactions with neighbouring RyRs.

The small delta subunit consists of a single membrane-spanning helix. Calmodulin binds to the Q motif of alpha1C subunit and acts as a Ca2+ sensor. Ca(2+)/CaM mediates a negative feedback regulation of the channel. CaBP1 eliminates this action of CaM through a poorly understood mechanism.

The Mediator complex is also targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and appears to regulate RNAPII at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNAPII specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of its C-terminal domain. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins. Reversibly associates with the CKM complex (CPX-3232, CPX-3263). Mediator lacking the CKM complex has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In contrast, Mediator containing the sub-complex represses basal transcription.	Molecular weight = >1 MDa.

A transmembrane channel specific for potassium and sensitive to voltage changes in the cell's membrane potential, composed of alpha and beta subunits. Alpha subunit (Kv4.2), is a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 2 protein. Beta subunit is an auxiliary, regulatory subunit, called Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (KChIP2) that modulates channel inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation in a calcium-dependent manner. During action potentials, the channel plays a crucial role in returning the depolarized cell to a resting state (repolarisation phase). It contributes to the cardiac transient outward current I(TO) in the heart and the somatodendritic A-type current I(SA) in neurons.These currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes.	The Kv4.2-KChIP2 complex is composed of four (alpha) Kv4.2 and four (beta) KChIP2 subunits. The alpha subunit (encoded by the kcnd2 gene) has six membrane spans flanked by intracellular N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminus of Kv4.2 interacts with the cytosolic KChIP2 subunits. The C-terminus of Kv4.2 is important for the channel gating. The four alpha subunits create a central, membrane spanning, ion conducting pathway. The KChIP2 domain has four EF-hand-like domains and binds calcium ions. Overall the complex is ~85 angstrom tall with two prominent domains. These domains are held apart by eight columns, four that are central and four at the channel periphery that are offset by 45 degrees and link the smaller and larger domains.

Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighboring R-Smad subunits.

A transmembrane channel specific for potassium and sensitive to voltage changes in the cell's membrane potential, composed of alpha and beta subunits. Alpha subunit (Kv4.3), is a potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 protein. Beta subunit is an auxiliary, regulatory subunit, called Kv channel-interacting protein 1 (KChIP1) that modulates channels density, inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation in a calcium-dependent manner. During action potentials, the channel plays a crucial role in returning the depolarized cell to a resting state (repolarisation phase). It contributes to the cardiac transient outward current I(TO) in the heart and the somatodendritic A-type current I(SA) in neurons.These currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes.	The Kv4.3-KChIP1 complex is composed of four (alpha) Kv4.3 and four (beta) KChIP1 subunits. The alpha subunit (encoded by the kcnd33 gene) has six membrane spans flanked by intracellular N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminus of Kv4.3 interacts with the cytosolic KChIP1 subunits. One KChIP1 molecule binds to two neighbouring Kv4.3 N-termini, with two contact interfaces being involved in the interaction. This ‘molecular clamp’ is propagated four times, thereby stabilizing the tetramerization of Kv4.3 channels. The four alpha subunits create a central, membrane-spanning, ion-conducting pathway. The KChIP1 domain has four EF-hand-like domains and binds calcium ions.

IKs is a major repolarization current in the heart that responds rapidly and robustly to sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Binding of beta subunit MinK (KCNE1) modifies the gating properties of the channel: it increases the single channel conductance, slows the rate of activation and removes (or greatly slows) inactivation of KCNQ1 alpha subunits.	KvLQT1 (or KCNQ1) is the alpha subunit and MinK (or KCNE1) the beta subunit of the channel. The two subunits coassemble to form heteromultimer channels, with unknown and probably varying stoichiometry. Based on other voltage-gated K+ channels it is assumed that four KCNQ1 alpha subunits coassemble to form the pore-forming unit, however specific structural evidence is lacking. Evidence suggests that more than one MinK subunit might interact with each KCNQ1 subunit. It is believed that KCNQ1 alpha subunits can also coassemble between them only, to form functional homomultimers, however the presence of MinK is required to reproduce the kinetic properties of the native IKs current. Also, MinK coassembly is necessary to mediate the characteristic IKs response to sympathetic stimulation. 	-	K+ (CHEBI:29103)	Familial short QT syndrome is a cardiologic entity that associates a short QT interval (QT and QTc 300 ms) on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) with a high risk of syncope or sudden death due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia.

Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. I(KACh) is expressed in cardiac muscle, specifically the sinoatrial node and atria. Regulation of I(KACh) via G protein-coupled receptor signaling underlies the control of heart rate. I(KACh) channel couples to the muscarinic M2 and adenosine A1 receptors. Binding of acetylcholine or adenosine to its respective receptor activates I(KACh), which plays a crucial role in regulating the heartbeat.

However, other heteromultimers are also possible. Probably, it has a typical GIRK channel complex structure, consisting of domains which span the plasma membrane to form a K+ selective pore region, through which K+ flow.

Together with tropomyosin, cTn is generally located along polymerised actin, which forms the backbone of the cardiomyocyte thin filament. At resting levels of intracellular calcium, the cTn complex keeps tropomyosin in a position that prevents force-producing interactions between myosin heads and actin. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium binds to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, triggering a series of protein structural changes and tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and/or shorten the sarcomere of the cardiomyocyte.

Usually chronic, primarily of the joints, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures, widespread fibrinoid degeneration of the collagen fibers in mesenchymal tissues, and by atrophy and rarefaction of bony structures.|Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases due to complete IL12B deficiency (MSMD) [Orphanet:319558]: an autosomal recessive disorder due to complete interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL12B) deficiency is a genetic variant of MSMD characterized by mild bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infections and recurrent Salmonella infections. Presents in early childhood. BCG is the most common infection encountered, usually after receiving the vaccination. Non-typhoidal Salmonella infections are also seen in half of all cases. Other infections have been reported, including chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), nocardiosis, and klebsiellosis. Incomplete clinical penetrance observed in this immunodeficiency.|Crohn's disease [EFO:0000384]: a chronic transmural inflammation that may involve any part of the digestive tract from mouth to anus, mostly found in the ileum, the cecum, and the colon. In Crohn disease, the inflammation, extending through the intestinal wall from the mucosa to the serosa, is characteristically asymmetric and segmental. Epithelioid granulomas may be seen in some patients.|Spondyloarthropathy [EFO:0000706]: a heterogeneous group of arthritic diseases sharing clinical and radiologic features. They are associated with the HLA-B27 antigen and some with a triggering infection. Most involve the axial joints in the spine, particularly the sacroiliac joint, but can also involve asymmetric peripheral joints. Subsets include ankylosing spondylitis; reactive arthritis; psoratic arthritis; and others.|Systemic lupus erythematosus [EFO:0002690]: a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory, and often febrile multisystemic disorder of connective tissue, characterized principally by involvement of the skin, joints, kidneys, and serosal membranes. It is of unknown etiology, but is thought to represent a failure of the regulatory mechanisms of the autoimmune system. The disease is marked by a wide range of system dysfunctions, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the formation of LE cells in the blood or bone marrow.|Multiple sclerosis [EFO:0003885]: an autoimmune disorder mainly affecting young adults and characterized by destruction of myelin in the central nervous system. Pathologic findings include multiple sharply demarcated areas of demyelination throughout the white matter of the central nervous system. Clinical manifestations include visual loss, extra-ocular movement disorders, paresthesias, loss of sensation, weakness, dysarthria, spasticity, ataxia, and bladder dysfunction. The usual pattern is one of recurrent attacks followed by partial recovery but acute fulminating and chronic progressive forms also occur.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P29460-PRO_0000010930(1)|Q9NPF7-PRO_0000259488(1)
